; SUMMARY
; The report gives a defining description of the program-
; ming language Scheme. Scheme is a statically scoped and
; properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp programming
; language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald
; Jay Sussman. It was designed to have an exceptionally
; clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form
; expressions. A wide variety of programming paradigms, in-
; cluding imperative, functional, and message passing styles,
; find convenient expression in Scheme.
; The introduction offers a brief history of the language and
; of the report.
; The first three chapters present the fundamental ideas of
; the language and describe the notational conventions used
; for describing the language and for writing programs in the
; language.
; Chapters 4 and 5 describe the syntax and semantics of
; expressions, programs, and definitions.
; Chapter 6 describes Scheme's built-in procedures, which
; include all of the language's data manipulation and in-
; put/output primitives.
; Chapter 7 provides a formal syntax for Scheme written in
; extended BNF, along with a formal denotational semantics.
; An example of the use of the language follows the formal
; syntax and semantics.
; The report concludes with a list of references and an al-
; phabetic index.

; INTRODUCTION
; 
; Programming languages should be designed not by piling
; feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses
; and restrictions that make additional features appear nec-
; essary. Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of
; rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how
; they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient
; programming language that is flexible enough to support
; most of the major programming paradigms in use today.
; Scheme was one of the first programming languages to in-
; corporate first class procedures as in the lambda calculus,
; thereby proving the usefulness of static scope rules and
; block structure in a dynamically typed language. Scheme
; was the first major dialect of Lisp to distinguish procedures
; from lambda expressions and symbols, to use a single lex-
; ical environment for all variables, and to evaluate the op-
; erator position of a procedure call in the same way as an
; operand position. By relying entirely on procedure calls
; to express iteration, Scheme emphasized the fact that tail-
; recursive procedure calls are essentially goto's that pass
; arguments. Scheme was the first widely used program-
; ming language to embrace first class escape procedures,
; from which all previously known sequential control struc-
; tures can be synthesized. A subsequent version of Scheme
; introduced the concept of exact and inexact numbers, an
; extension of Common Lisp's generic arithmetic. More re-
; cently, Scheme became the first programming language to
; support hygienic macros, which permit the syntax of a
; block-structured language to be extended in a consistent
; and reliable manner.
; 
; Background
; 
; The first description of Scheme was written in 1975 [28]. A
; revised report [25] appeared in 1978, which described the
; evolution of the language as its MIT implementation was
; upgraded to support an innovative compiler [26]. Three
; distinct projects began in 1981 and 1982 to use variants
; of Scheme for courses at MIT, Yale, and Indiana Univer-
; sity [21, 17, 10]. An introductory computer science text-
; book using Scheme was published in 1984 [1].
; As Scheme became more widespread, local dialects be-
; gan to diverge until students and researchers occasion-
; ally found it difficult to understand code written at other
; sites. Fifteen representatives of the major implementations
; of Scheme therefore met in October 1984 to work toward
; a better and more widely accepted standard for Scheme.
; Their report [4] was published at MIT and Indiana Uni-
; versity in the summer of 1985. Further revision took place
; in the spring of 1986 [23], and in the spring of 1988 [6].
; The present report reflects further revisions agreed upon
; in a meeting at Xerox PARC in June 1992.
; We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme com-
; munity, and so we grant permission to copy it in whole or in
; part without fee. In particular, we encourage implementors
; of Scheme to use this report as a starting point for manuals
; and other documentation, modifying it as necessary.

; 1. Overview of Scheme 3
; 
; DESCRIPTION OF THE LANGUAGE
; 1.     Overview of Scheme
; 1.1. Semantics
; 
; This section gives an overview of Scheme's semantics. A
; detailed informal semantics is the subject of chapters 3
; through 6. For reference purposes, section 7.2 provides a
; formal semantics of Scheme.
; Following Algol, Scheme is a statically scoped program-
; ming language. Each use of a variable is associated with a
; lexically apparent binding of that variable.
; Scheme has latent as opposed to manifest types. Types
; are associated with values (also called objects) rather than
; with variables. (Some authors refer to languages with
; latent types as weakly typed or dynamically typed lan-
; guages.) Other languages with latent types are APL,
; Snobol, and other dialects of Lisp. Languages with mani-
; fest types (sometimes referred to as strongly typed or stat-
; ically typed languages) include Algol 60, Pascal, and C.
; All objects created in the course of a Scheme computation,
; including procedures and continuations, have unlimited ex-
; tent. No Scheme object is ever destroyed. The reason that
; implementations of Scheme do not (usually!) run out of
; storage is that they are permitted to reclaim the storage
; occupied by an object if they can prove that the object
; cannot possibly matter to any future computation. Other
; languages in which most objects have unlimited extent in-
; clude APL and other Lisp dialects.
; Implementations of Scheme are required to be properly
; tail-recursive. This allows the execution of an iterative
; computation in constant space, even if the iterative compu-
; tation is described by a syntactically recursive procedure.
; Thus with a properly tail-recursive implementation, iter-
; ation can be expressed using the ordinary procedure-call
; mechanics, so that special iteration constructs are useful
; only as syntactic sugar. See section 3.5.
; Scheme procedures are objects in their own right. Pro-
; cedures can be created dynamically, stored in data struc-
; tures, returned as results of procedures, and so on. Other
; languages with these properties include Common Lisp and
; ML.
; One distinguishing feature of Scheme is that continuations,
; which in most other languages only operate behind the
; scenes, also have "first-class" status. Continuations are
; useful for implementing a wide variety of advanced control
; constructs, including non-local exits, backtracking, and
; coroutines. See section 6.4.
; Arguments to Scheme procedures are always passed by
; value, which means that the actual argument expressions
; are evaluated before the procedure gains control, whether
; the procedure needs the result of the evaluation or not.
; ML, C, and APL are three other languages that always
; pass arguments by value. This is distinct from the lazy-
; evaluation semantics of Haskell, or the call-by-name se-
; mantics of Algol 60, where an argument expression is not
; evaluated unless its value is needed by the procedure.
; Scheme's model of arithmetic is designed to remain as in-
; dependent as possible of the particular ways in which num-
; bers are represented within a computer. In Scheme, every
; integer is a rational number, every rational is a real, and
; every real is a complex number. Thus the distinction be-
; tween integer and real arithmetic, so important to many
; programming languages, does not appear in Scheme. In its
; place is a distinction between exact arithmetic, which cor-
; responds to the mathematical ideal, and inexact arithmetic
; on approximations. As in Common Lisp, exact arithmetic
; is not limited to integers.
; 
; 
; 1.2. Syntax
; 
; Scheme, like most dialects of Lisp, employs a fully paren-
; thesized prefix notation for programs and (other) data; the
; grammar of Scheme generates a sublanguage of the lan-
; guage used for data. An important consequence of this sim-
; ple, uniform representation is the susceptibility of Scheme
; programs and data to uniform treatment by other Scheme
; programs. For example, the eval procedure evaluates a
; Scheme program expressed as data.
; The read procedure performs syntactic as well as lexical
; decomposition of the data it reads. The read procedure
; parses its input as data (section 7.1.2), not as program.
; The formal syntax of Scheme is described in section 7.1.
; 
; 
; 1.3. Notation and terminology
; 
; 1.3.1. Primitive, library, and optional features
; 
; It is required that every implementation of Scheme support
; all features that are not marked as being optional. Imple-
; mentations are free to omit optional features of Scheme
; or to add extensions, provided the extensions are not in
; conflict with the language reported here. In particular,
; implementations must support portable code by providing
; a syntactic mode that preempts no lexical conventions of
; this report.
; To aid in understanding and implementing Scheme, some
; features are marked as library. These can be easily imple-
; mented in terms of the other, primitive, features. They are
; redundant in the strict sense of the word, but they capture
; common patterns of usage, and are therefore provided as
; convenient abbreviations.

; 
; 1.3.2. Error situations and unspecified behavior
; 
; When speaking of an error situation, this report uses the
; phrase "an error is signalled" to indicate that implemen-
; tations must detect and report the error. If such wording
; does not appear in the discussion of an error, then imple-
; mentations are not required to detect or report the error,
; though they are encouraged to do so. An error situation
; that implementations are not required to detect is usually
; referred to simply as "an error."
; For example, it is an error for a procedure to be passed an
; argument that the procedure is not explicitly specified to
; handle, even though such domain errors are seldom men-
; tioned in this report. Implementations may extend a pro-
; cedure's domain of definition to include such arguments.
; This report uses the phrase "may report a violation of an
; implementation restriction" to indicate circumstances un-
; der which an implementation is permitted to report that
; it is unable to continue execution of a correct program be-
; cause of some restriction imposed by the implementation.
; Implementation restrictions are of course discouraged, but
; implementations are encouraged to report violations of im-
; plementation restrictions.
; For example, an implementation may report a violation of
; an implementation restriction if it does not have enough
; storage to run a program.
; If the value of an expression is said to be "unspecified,"
; then the expression must evaluate to some object without
; signalling an error, but the value depends on the imple-
; mentation; this report explicitly does not say what value
; should be returned.
; 
; 1.3.3. Entry format
; 
; Chapters 4 and 6 are organized into entries. Each entry de-
; scribes one language feature or a group of related features,
; where a feature is either a syntactic construct or a built-in
; procedure. An entry begins with one or more header lines
; of the form
; template                                            category
; for required, primitive features, or
; template                                  qualifier category
; where qualifier is either "library" or "optional" as defined
; in section 1.3.1.
; If category is "syntax", the entry describes an expression
; type, and the template gives the syntax of the expression
; type. Components of expressions are designated by syn-
; tactic variables, which are written using angle brackets,
; for example,  expression ,  variable . Syntactic variables
; should be understood to denote segments of program text;
; for example,  expression  stands for any string of charac-
; ters which is a syntactically valid expression. The notation
;  thing1  . . .
; indicates zero or more occurrences of a  thing , and
;  thing1   thing2  . . .
; indicates one or more occurrences of a  thing .
; If category is "procedure", then the entry describes a pro-
; cedure, and the header line gives a template for a call to the
; procedure. Argument names in the template are italicized.
; Thus the header line
; (vector-ref vector k)                                  procedure
; indicates that the built-in procedure vector-ref takes two
; arguments, a vector vector and an exact non-negative in-
; teger k (see below). The header lines
; (make-vector k)                                        procedure
; (make-vector k fill)                                   procedure
; indicate that the make-vector procedure must be defined
; to take either one or two arguments.
; It is an error for an operation to be presented with an ar-
; gument that it is not specified to handle. For succinctness,
; we follow the convention that if an argument name is also
; the name of a type listed in section 3.2, then that argu-
; ment must be of the named type. For example, the header
; line for vector-ref given above dictates that the first ar-
; gument to vector-ref must be a vector. The following
; naming conventions also imply type restrictions:
; 
; obj                          any object
; list, list1, . . . listj, . . . list (see section 6.3.2)
; z, z1, . . . zj, . . .       complex number
; x, x1, . . . xj, . . .       real number
; y, y1, . . . yj, . . .       real number
; q, q1, . . . qj, . . .       rational number
; n, n1, . . . nj, . . .       integer
; k, k1, . . . kj, . . .       exact non-negative integer
; 
; 1.3.4. Evaluation examples
; 
; The symbol "= " used in program examples should be
; read "evaluates to." For example,
; (* 5 8)                            =  40
; means that the expression (* 5 8) evaluates to the ob-
; ject 40. Or, more precisely: the expression given by the
; sequence of characters "(* 5 8)" evaluates, in the initial
; environment, to an object that may be represented exter-
; nally by the sequence of characters "40". See section 3.3
; for a discussion of external representations of objects.
; 
; 1.3.5. Naming conventions
; 
; By convention, the names of procedures that always return
; a boolean value usually end in "?". Such procedures are
; called predicates.
; 
; 
; 
; 2. Lexical conventions 5
; 
; By convention, the names of procedures that store values
; into previously allocated locations (see section 3.4) usually
; end in "!". Such procedures are called mutation proce-
; dures. By convention, the value returned by a mutation
; procedure is unspecified.
; By convention, "->" appears within the names of proce-
; dures that take an object of one type and return an anal-
; ogous object of another type. For example, list->vector
; takes a list and returns a vector whose elements are the
; same as those of the list.
; 
; 
; 2.         Lexical conventions
; This section gives an informal account of some of the lexical
; conventions used in writing Scheme programs. For a formal
; syntax of Scheme, see section 7.1.
; Upper and lower case forms of a letter are never distin-
; guished except within character and string constants. For
; example, Foo is the same identifier as FOO, and #x1AB is
; the same number as #X1ab.
; 
; 
; 2.1. Identifiers
; 
; Most identifiers allowed by other programming languages
; are also acceptable to Scheme. The precise rules for form-
; ing identifiers vary among implementations of Scheme, but
; in all implementations a sequence of letters, digits, and "ex-
; tended alphabetic characters" that begins with a character
; that cannot begin a number is an identifier. In addition,
; +, -, and ... are identifiers. Here are some examples of
; identifiers:
; 
; lambda                         q
; list->vector                   soup
; +                              V17a
; <=?                            a34kTMNs
; the-word-recursion-has-many-meanings
; 
; Extended alphabetic characters may be used within iden-
; tifiers as if they were letters. The following are extended
; alphabetic characters:
; 
; ! $ % & * + - . / : < = > ? @ ^ _ ~
; 
; See section 7.1.1 for a formal syntax of identifiers.
; Identifiers have two uses within Scheme programs:
; 
; * Any identifier may be used as a variable or as a syn-
; tactic keyword (see sections 3.1 and 4.3).
; 
; * When an identifier appears as a literal or within a
; literal (see section 4.1.2), it is being used to denote a
; symbol (see section 6.3.3).
; 2.2. Whitespace and comments
; 
; Whitespace characters are spaces and newlines. (Imple-
; mentations typically provide additional whitespace char-
; acters such as tab or page break.) Whitespace is used for
; improved readability and as necessary to separate tokens
; from each other, a token being an indivisible lexical unit
; such as an identifier or number, but is otherwise insignifi-
; cant. Whitespace may occur between any two tokens, but
; not within a token. Whitespace may also occur inside a
; string, where it is significant.
; A semicolon (;) indicates the start of a comment. The
; comment continues to the end of the line on which the
; semicolon appears. Comments are invisible to Scheme, but
; the end of the line is visible as whitespace. This prevents a
; comment from appearing in the middle of an identifier or
; number.
; 
; ;;; The FACT procedure computes the factorial
; ;;; of a non-negative integer.
; (define fact
; (lambda (n)
; (if (= n 0)
; 1         ;Base case: return 1
; (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
; 
; 
; 2.3. Other notations
; 
; For a description of the notations used for numbers, see
; section 6.2.
; 
; . + - These are used in numbers, and may also occur
; anywhere in an identifier except as the first charac-
; ter. A delimited plus or minus sign by itself is also an
; identifier. A delimited period (not occurring within a
; number or identifier) is used in the notation for pairs
; (section 6.3.2), and to indicate a rest-parameter in a
; formal parameter list (section 4.1.4). A delimited se-
; quence of three successive periods is also an identifier.
; 
; ( ) Parentheses are used for grouping and to notate lists
; (section 6.3.2).
; 
; ' The single quote character is used to indicate literal data
; (section 4.1.2).
; 
;   The backquote character is used to indicate almost-
; constant data (section 4.2.6).
; 
; , ,@ The character comma and the sequence comma at-
; sign are used in conjunction with backquote (sec-
; tion 4.2.6).
; 
; " The double quote character is used to delimit strings
; (section 6.3.5).
; 
; 
; 
; 6 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; \ Backslash is used in the syntax for character constants
; (section 6.3.4) and as an escape character within
; string constants (section 6.3.5).
; 
; [ ] { } | Left and right square brackets and curly braces
; and vertical bar are reserved for possible future exten-
; sions to the language.
; 
; # Sharp sign is used for a variety of purposes depending
; on the character that immediately follows it:
; 
; #t #f These are the boolean constants (section 6.3.1).
; 
; #\ This introduces a character constant (section 6.3.4).
; 
; #( This introduces a vector constant (section 6.3.6). Vec-
; tor constants are terminated by ) .
; 
; #e #i #b #o #d #x These are used in the notation for
; numbers (section 6.2.4).
; 
; 
; 3.      Basic concepts
; 3.1. Variables, syntactic keywords, and re-
; gions
; 
; An identifier may name a type of syntax, or it may name
; a location where a value can be stored. An identifier that
; names a type of syntax is called a syntactic keyword and is
; said to be bound to that syntax. An identifier that names
; a location is called a variable and is said to be bound to
; that location. The set of all visible bindings in effect at
; some point in a program is known as the environment in
; effect at that point. The value stored in the location to
; which a variable is bound is called the variable's value.
; By abuse of terminology, the variable is sometimes said
; to name the value or to be bound to the value. This is
; not quite accurate, but confusion rarely results from this
; practice.
; Certain expression types are used to create new kinds of
; syntax and bind syntactic keywords to those new syntaxes,
; while other expression types create new locations and bind
; variables to those locations. These expression types are
; called binding constructs. Those that bind syntactic key-
; words are listed in section 4.3. The most fundamental of
; the variable binding constructs is the lambda expression,
; because all other variable binding constructs can be ex-
; plained in terms of lambda expressions. The other variable
; binding constructs are let, let*, letrec, and do expres-
; sions (see sections 4.1.4, 4.2.2, and 4.2.4).
; Like Algol and Pascal, and unlike most other dialects of
; Lisp except for Common Lisp, Scheme is a statically scoped
; language with block structure. To each place where an
; identifier is bound in a program there corresponds a region
; of the program text within which the binding is visible.
; The region is determined by the particular binding con-
; struct that establishes the binding; if the binding is estab-
; lished by a lambda expression, for example, then its region
; is the entire lambda expression. Every mention of an iden-
; tifier refers to the binding of the identifier that established
; the innermost of the regions containing the use. If there is
; no binding of the identifier whose region contains the use,
; then the use refers to the binding for the variable in the
; top level environment, if any (chapters 4 and 6); if there
; is no binding for the identifier, it is said to be unbound.
; 
; 
; 3.2. Disjointness of types
; 
; No object satisfies more than one of the following predi-
; cates:
; 
; boolean?             pair?
; symbol?              number?
; char?                string?
; vector?              port?
; procedure?
; 
; These predicates define the types boolean, pair, symbol,
; number, char (or character), string, vector, port, and pro-
; cedure. The empty list is a special object of its own type;
; it satisfies none of the above predicates.
; Although there is a separate boolean type, any Scheme
; value can be used as a boolean value for the purpose of a
; conditional test. As explained in section 6.3.1, all values
; count as true in such a test except for #f. This report uses
; the word "true" to refer to any Scheme value except #f,
; and the word "false" to refer to #f.
; 
; 
; 3.3. External representations
; 
; An important concept in Scheme (and Lisp) is that of the
; external representation of an object as a sequence of char-
; acters. For example, an external representation of the inte-
; ger 28 is the sequence of characters "28", and an external
; representation of a list consisting of the integers 8 and 13
; is the sequence of characters "(8 13)".
; The external representation of an object is not neces-
; sarily unique. The integer 28 also has representations
; "#e28.000" and "#x1c", and the list in the previous para-
; graph also has the representations "( 08 13 )" and "(8
; . (13 . ()))" (see section 6.3.2).
; Many objects have standard external representations, but
; some, such as procedures, do not have standard represen-
; tations (although particular implementations may define
; representations for them).
; An external representation may be written in a program to
; obtain the corresponding object (see quote, section 4.1.2).
; 
; 
; 
; 3. Basic concepts 7
; 
; External representations can also be used for input and
; output. The procedure read (section 6.6.2) parses ex-
; ternal representations, and the procedure write (sec-
; tion 6.6.3) generates them. Together, they provide an
; elegant and powerful input/output facility.
; Note that the sequence of characters "(+ 2 6)" is not an
; external representation of the integer 8, even though it is an
; expression evaluating to the integer 8; rather, it is an exter-
; nal representation of a three-element list, the elements of
; which are the symbol + and the integers 2 and 6. Scheme's
; syntax has the property that any sequence of characters
; that is an expression is also the external representation of
; some object. This can lead to confusion, since it may not
; be obvious out of context whether a given sequence of char-
; acters is intended to denote data or program, but it is also
; a source of power, since it facilitates writing programs such
; as interpreters and compilers that treat programs as data
; (or vice versa).
; The syntax of external representations of various kinds of
; objects accompanies the description of the primitives for
; manipulating the objects in the appropriate sections of
; chapter 6.
; 
; 
; 3.4. Storage model
; 
; Variables and objects such as pairs, vectors, and strings
; implicitly denote locations or sequences of locations. A
; string, for example, denotes as many locations as there
; are characters in the string. (These locations need not
; correspond to a full machine word.) A new value may be
; stored into one of these locations using the string-set!
; procedure, but the string continues to denote the same
; locations as before.
; An object fetched from a location, by a variable reference or
; by a procedure such as car, vector-ref, or string-ref,
; is equivalent in the sense of eqv? (section 6.1) to the object
; last stored in the location before the fetch.
; Every location is marked to show whether it is in use. No
; variable or object ever refers to a location that is not in use.
; Whenever this report speaks of storage being allocated for
; a variable or object, what is meant is that an appropriate
; number of locations are chosen from the set of locations
; that are not in use, and the chosen locations are marked
; to indicate that they are now in use before the variable or
; object is made to denote them.
; In many systems it is desirable for constants (i.e. the val-
; ues of literal expressions) to reside in read-only-memory.
; To express this, it is convenient to imagine that every
; object that denotes locations is associated with a flag
; telling whether that object is mutable or immutable. In
; such systems literal constants and the strings returned by
; symbol->string are immutable objects, while all objects
; created by the other procedures listed in this report are
; mutable. It is an error to attempt to store a new value
; into a location that is denoted by an immutable object.
; 
; 3.5. Proper tail recursion
; 
; Implementations of Scheme are required to be properly tail-
; recursive. Procedure calls that occur in certain syntactic
; contexts defined below are `tail calls'. A Scheme imple-
; mentation is properly tail-recursive if it supports an un-
; bounded number of active tail calls. A call is active if
; the called procedure may still return. Note that this in-
; cludes calls that may be returned from either by the cur-
; rent continuation or by continuations captured earlier by
; call-with-current-continuation that are later invoked.
; In the absence of captured continuations, calls could return
; at most once and the active calls would be those that had
; not yet returned. A formal definition of proper tail recur-
; sion can be found in [8].
; Rationale:
; Intuitively, no space is needed for an active tail call because the
; continuation that is used in the tail call has the same semantics
; as the continuation passed to the procedure containing the call.
; Although an improper implementation might use a new con-
; tinuation in the call, a return to this new continuation would
; be followed immediately by a return to the continuation passed
; to the procedure. A properly tail-recursive implementation re-
; turns to that continuation directly.
; Proper tail recursion was one of the central ideas in Steele and
; Sussman's original version of Scheme. Their first Scheme in-
; terpreter implemented both functions and actors. Control flow
; was expressed using actors, which differed from functions in
; that they passed their results on to another actor instead of
; returning to a caller. In the terminology of this section, each
; actor finished with a tail call to another actor.
; Steele and Sussman later observed that in their interpreter the
; code for dealing with actors was identical to that for functions
; and thus there was no need to include both in the language.
; A tail call is a procedure call that occurs in a tail con-
; text. Tail contexts are defined inductively. Note that a tail
; context is always determined with respect to a particular
; lambda expression.
; 
; * The last expression within the body of a lambda ex-
; pression, shown as  tail expression  below, occurs in a
; tail context.
; 
; (lambda  formals 
;  definition *  expression *  tail expression )
; 
; 
; * If one of the following expressions is in a tail context,
; then the subexpressions shown as  tail expression  are
; in a tail context. These were derived from rules in
; 
; 
; 
; 8 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; the grammar given in chapter 7 by replacing some oc-
; currences of  expression  with  tail expression . Only
; those rules that contain tail contexts are shown here.
; 
; (if  expression   tail expression   tail expression )
; (if  expression   tail expression )
; 
; (cond  cond clause +)
; (cond  cond clause * (else  tail sequence ))
; 
; (case  expression 
;  case clause +)
; (case  expression 
;  case clause *
; (else  tail sequence ))
; 
; (and  expression *  tail expression )
; (or  expression *  tail expression )
; 
; (let ( binding spec *)  tail body )
; (let  variable  ( binding spec *)  tail body )
; (let* ( binding spec *)  tail body )
; (letrec ( binding spec *)  tail body )
; 
; (let-syntax ( syntax spec *)  tail body )
; (letrec-syntax ( syntax spec *)  tail body )
; 
; (begin  tail sequence )
; 
; (do ( iteration spec *)
; ( test   tail sequence )
;  expression *)
; 
; where
; 
;  cond clause  -  ( test   tail sequence )
;  case clause  -  (( datum *)  tail sequence )
; 
;  tail body  -   definition *  tail sequence 
;  tail sequence  -   expression *  tail expression 
; 
; 
; * If a cond expression is in a tail context, and has a
; clause of the form ( expression1  =>  expression2 )
; then the (implied) call to the procedure that results
; from the evaluation of  expression2  is in a tail context.
;  expression2  itself is not in a tail context.
; 
; Certain built-in procedures are also required to perform
; tail calls. The first argument passed to apply and to
; call-with-current-continuation, and the second argu-
; ment passed to call-with-values, must be called via a
; tail call. Similarly, eval must evaluate its argument as if
; it were in tail position within the eval procedure.
; In the following example the only tail call is the call to f.
; None of the calls to g or h are tail calls. The reference to
; x is in a tail context, but it is not a call and thus is not a
; tail call.
; (lambda ()
; (if (g)
; (let ((x (h)))
; x)
; (and (g) (f))))
; 
; Note: Implementations are allowed, but not required, to recog-
; nize that some non-tail calls, such as the call to h above, can be
; evaluated as though they were tail calls. In the example above,
; the let expression could be compiled as a tail call to h. (The
; possibility of h returning an unexpected number of values can
; be ignored, because in that case the effect of the let is explicitly
; unspecified and implementation-dependent.)
; 
; 4.         Expressions
; Expression types are categorized as primitive or derived.
; Primitive expression types include variables and procedure
; calls. Derived expression types are not semantically prim-
; itive, but can instead be defined as macros. With the ex-
; ception of quasiquote, whose macro definition is complex,
; the derived expressions are classified as library features.
; Suitable definitions are given in section 7.3.

; An expression consisting of a variable (section 3.1) is a
; variable reference. The value of the variable reference is
; the value stored in the location to which the variable is
; bound. It is an error to reference an unbound variable.

; cedure like set-car! or string-set!.
; 
; 4.1.3. Procedure calls
; 
; ( operator   operand1  . . . )                           syntax
; A procedure call is written by simply enclosing in paren-
; theses expressions for the procedure to be called and the
; arguments to be passed to it. The operator and operand
; expressions are evaluated (in an unspecified order) and the
; resulting procedure is passed the resulting arguments.
; (+ 3 4)                          =  7
; ((if #f + *) 3 4)                =  12
; A number of procedures are available as the values of vari-
; ables in the initial environment; for example, the addition
; and multiplication procedures in the above examples are
; the values of the variables + and *. New procedures are cre-
; ated by evaluating lambda expressions (see section 4.1.4).
; Procedure calls may return any number of values (see
; values in section 6.4). With the exception of values the
; procedures available in the initial environment return one
; value or, for procedures such as apply, pass on the values
; returned by a call to one of their arguments.
; Procedure calls are also called combinations.
; Note:       In contrast to other dialects of Lisp, the order of
; evaluation is unspecified, and the operator expression and the
; operand expressions are always evaluated with the same evalu-
; ation rules.
; Note: Although the order of evaluation is otherwise unspeci-
; fied, the effect of any concurrent evaluation of the operator and
; operand expressions is constrained to be consistent with some
; sequential order of evaluation. The order of evaluation may be
; chosen differently for each procedure call.
; Note: In many dialects of Lisp, the empty combination, (),
; is a legitimate expression. In Scheme, combinations must have
; at least one subexpression, so () is not a syntactically valid
; expression.

; Syntax:  Formals  should be a formal arguments list as
; described below, and  body  should be a sequence of one
; or more expressions.
; Semantics: A lambda expression evaluates to a procedure.
; The environment in effect when the lambda expression was
; evaluated is remembered as part of the procedure. When
; the procedure is later called with some actual arguments,
; the environment in which the lambda expression was evalu-
; ated will be extended by binding the variables in the formal
; argument list to fresh locations, the corresponding actual
; argument values will be stored in those locations, and the
; expressions in the body of the lambda expression will be
; evaluated sequentially in the extended environment. The
; result(s) of the last expression in the body will be returned
; as the result(s) of the procedure call.

; (add4 6)                        =  10
;  Formals  should have one of the following forms:
; 
; * ( variable1  . . . ): The procedure takes a fixed num-
; ber of arguments; when the procedure is called, the
; arguments will be stored in the bindings of the corre-
; sponding variables.
; *  variable : The procedure takes any number of ar-
; guments; when the procedure is called, the sequence
; of actual arguments is converted into a newly allo-
; cated list, and the list is stored in the binding of the
;  variable .
; * ( variable1  . . .  variablen  .  variablen+1 ): If a
; space-delimited period precedes the last variable, then
; the procedure takes n or more arguments, where n
; is the number of formal arguments before the period
; (there must be at least one). The value stored in the
; binding of the last variable will be a newly allocated
; list of the actual arguments left over after all the other
; actual arguments have been matched up against the
; other formal arguments.

; macro definitions that will convert most of the constructs

;

; Syntax: Each  clause  should be of the form
; ( test   expression1  . . . )
; where  test  is any expression. Alternatively, a  clause 
; may be of the form
; ( test  =>  expression )
; The last  clause  may be an "else clause," which has the
; form
; (else  expression1   expression2  . . . ).
; Semantics: A cond expression is evaluated by evaluating
; the  test  expressions of successive  clause s in order until
; one of them evaluates to a true value (see section 6.3.1).
; When a  test  evaluates to a true value, then the remain-
; ing  expression s in its  clause  are evaluated in order,
; and the result(s) of the last  expression  in the  clause 
; is(are) returned as the result(s) of the entire cond expres-
; sion. If the selected  clause  contains only the  test  and no
;  expression s, then the value of the  test  is returned as the
; result. If the selected  clause  uses the => alternate form,
; then the  expression  is evaluated. Its value must be a pro-
; cedure that accepts one argument; this procedure is then
; called on the value of the  test  and the value(s) returned
; by this procedure is(are) returned by the cond expression.
; If all  test s evaluate to false values, and there is no else
; clause, then the result of the conditional expression is un-
; specified; if there is an else clause, then its  expression s are
; evaluated, and the value(s) of the last one is(are) returned.

;  clause  may be an "else clause," which has the form
; (else  expression1   expression2  . . . ).
; Semantics: A case expression is evaluated as follows.
;  Key  is evaluated and its result is compared against each
;  datum . If the result of evaluating  key  is equivalent
; (in the sense of eqv?; see section 6.1) to a  datum , then

; every  datum , then if there is an else clause its expres-
; sions are evaluated and the result(s) of the last is(are) the
; result(s) of the case expression; otherwise the result of the
; case expression is unspecified.

; false values, the value of the last expression is returned. If
; there are no expressions then #f is returned.

; 4.2.2. Binding constructs
; 
; The three binding constructs let, let*, and letrec give
; Scheme a block structure, like Algol 60. The syntax of the
; three constructs is identical, but they differ in the regions
; they establish for their variable bindings. In a let ex-
; pression, the initial values are computed before any of the
; variables become bound; in a let* expression, the bind-
; ings and evaluations are performed sequentially; while in a
; letrec expression, all the bindings are in effect while their
; initial values are being computed, thus allowing mutually
; recursive definitions.
; 
; (let  bindings   body )                          library syntax
; Syntax:  Bindings  should have the form
; (( variable1   init1 ) . . . ),
; where each  init  is an expression, and  body  should be a
; sequence of one or more expressions. It is an error for a
;  variable  to appear more than once in the list of variables
; being bound.
; Semantics: The  init s are evaluated in the current envi-
; ronment (in some unspecified order), the  variable s are
; bound to fresh locations holding the results, the  body  is
; evaluated in the extended environment, and the value(s) of
; the last expression of  body  is(are) returned. Each bind-
; ing of a  variable  has  body  as its region.
; (let ((x 2) (y 3))
; (* x y))                     =  6
; 
; (let ((x 2) (y 3))
; (let ((x 7)
; (z (+ x y)))
; (* z x)))                   =  35
; 
; See also named let, section 4.2.4.
; 
; (let*  bindings   body )                         library syntax
; Syntax:  Bindings  should have the form
; (( variable1   init1 ) . . . ),
; and  body  should be a sequence of one or more expres-
; sions.
; Semantics: Let* is similar to let, but the bindings are
; performed sequentially from left to right, and the region of
; a binding indicated by ( variable   init ) is that part of
; the let* expression to the right of the binding. Thus the
; second binding is done in an environment in which the first
; binding is visible, and so on.
; (let ((x 2) (y 3))
; (let* ((x 7)
; (z (+ x y)))
; (* z x)))                   =  70
; 
; 
; (letrec  bindings   body )                       library syntax
; Syntax:  Bindings  should have the form
; (( variable1   init1 ) . . . ),
; and  body  should be a sequence of one or more expres-
; sions. It is an error for a  variable  to appear more than
; once in the list of variables being bound.
; Semantics: The  variable s are bound to fresh locations
; holding undefined values, the  init s are evaluated in the
; 
; 
; 
; 12 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; resulting environment (in some unspecified order), each
;  variable  is assigned to the result of the corresponding
;  init , the  body  is evaluated in the resulting environment,
; and the value(s) of the last expression in  body  is(are) re-
; turned. Each binding of a  variable  has the entire letrec
; expression as its region, making it possible to define mutu-
; ally recursive procedures.
; (letrec ((even?
; (lambda (n)
; (if (zero? n)
; #t
; (odd? (- n 1)))))
; (odd?
; (lambda (n)
; (if (zero? n)
; #f
; (even? (- n 1))))))
; (even? 88))
; =  #t
; 
; One restriction on letrec is very important: it must be
; possible to evaluate each  init  without assigning or refer-
; ring to the value of any  variable . If this restriction is
; violated, then it is an error. The restriction is necessary
; because Scheme passes arguments by value rather than by
; name. In the most common uses of letrec, all the  init s
; are lambda expressions and the restriction is satisfied au-
; tomatically.
; 
; 4.2.3. Sequencing
; 
; (begin  expression1   expression2  . . . ) library syntax
; The  expression s are evaluated sequentially from left to
; right, and the value(s) of the last  expression  is(are) re-
; turned. This expression type is used to sequence side ef-
; fects such as input and output.
; (define x 0)
; 
; (begin (set! x 5)
; (+ x 1))               =  6
;

; (display (+ 4 1)))     =  unspecified
; and prints 4 plus 1 equals 5

; 4.2.4. Iteration
; 
; (do (( variable1   init1   step1 )                  library syntax
; . . . )
; ( test   expression  . . . )
;  command  . . . )
; Do is an iteration construct. It specifies a set of variables
; to be bound, how they are to be initialized at the start,
; and how they are to be updated on each iteration. When a
; termination condition is met, the loop exits after evaluating
; the  expression s.
; Do expressions are evaluated as follows: The  init  ex-
; pressions are evaluated (in some unspecified order), the
;  variable s are bound to fresh locations, the results of
; the  init  expressions are stored in the bindings of the
;  variable s, and then the iteration phase begins.
; Each iteration begins by evaluating  test ; if the result is
; false (see section 6.3.1), then the  command  expressions
; are evaluated in order for effect, the  step  expressions
; are evaluated in some unspecified order, the  variable s
; are bound to fresh locations, the results of the  step s are
; stored in the bindings of the  variable s, and the next iter-
; ation begins.
; If  test  evaluates to a true value, then the  expression s
; are evaluated from left to right and the value(s) of the
; last  expression  is(are) returned. If no  expression s are
; present, then the value of the do expression is unspecified.
; The region of the binding of a  variable  consists of the
; entire do expression except for the  init s. It is an error
; for a  variable  to appear more than once in the list of do
; variables.
; A  step  may be omitted, in which case the effect is the
; same as if ( variable   init   variable ) had been written
; instead of ( variable   init ).

; (let  variable   bindings   body )                library syntax
; "Named let" is a variant on the syntax of let which pro-
; vides a more general looping construct than do and may
; also be used to express recursions. It has the same syn-
; tax and semantics as ordinary let except that  variable 
; is bound within  body  to a procedure whose formal argu-
; ments are the bound variables and whose body is  body .
; Thus the execution of  body  may be repeated by invoking
; the procedure named by  variable .

; 
; (delay  expression )                         library syntax
; The delay construct is used together with the proce-
; dure force to implement lazy evaluation or call by need.
; (delay  expression ) returns an object called a promise
; which at some point in the future may be asked (by the
; force procedure) to evaluate  expression , and deliver the
; resulting value. The effect of  expression  returning multi-
; ple values is unspecified.
; See the description of force (section 6.4) for a more com-
; plete description of delay.

; 4.2.6. Quasiquotation
; 
; (quasiquote  qq template )                            syntax
;   qq template                                         syntax
; "Backquote" or "quasiquote" expressions are useful for
; constructing a list or vector structure when most but not
; all of the desired structure is known in advance. If no
; commas appear within the  qq template , the result of
; evaluating   qq template  is equivalent to the result of
; evaluating ' qq template . If a comma appears within
; the  qq template , however, the expression following the
; comma is evaluated ("unquoted") and its result is inserted
; into the structure instead of the comma and the expres-
; sion. If a comma appears followed immediately by an at-
; sign (@), then the following expression must evaluate to
; a list; the opening and closing parentheses of the list are
; then "stripped away" and the elements of the list are in-
; serted in place of the comma at-sign expression sequence.
; A comma at-sign should only appear within a list or vector
;  qq template .
;  (list ,(+ 1 2) 4)             =  (list 3 4)
; (let ((name 'a))  (list ,name ',name))
; =  (list a (quote a))
;  (a ,(+ 1 2) ,@(map abs '(4 -5 6)) b)
; =  (a 3 4 5 6 b)
;  (( foo ,(- 10 3)) ,@(cdr '(c)) . ,(car '(cons)))
; =  ((foo 7) . cons)
;  #(10 5 ,(sqrt 4) ,@(map sqrt '(16 9)) 8)
; =  #(10 5 2 4 3 8)
; 
; Quasiquote forms may be nested. Substitutions are made
; only for unquoted components appearing at the same nest-
; ing level as the outermost backquote. The nesting level in-
; creases by one inside each successive quasiquotation, and
; decreases by one inside each unquotation.
;  (a  (b ,(+ 1 2) ,(foo ,(+ 1 3) d) e) f)
; =  (a  (b ,(+ 1 2) ,(foo 4 d) e) f)
; (let ((name1 'x)
; (name2 'y))
;  (a  (b ,,name1 ,',name2 d) e))
; =  (a  (b ,x ,'y d) e)
; 
; The two notations   qq template  and (quasiquote
;  qq template ) are identical in all respects. , expression 
; is identical to (unquote  expression ), and ,@ expression 
; is identical to (unquote-splicing  expression ). The ex-
; ternal syntax generated by write for two-element lists
; whose car is one of these symbols may vary between im-
; plementations.
; (quasiquote (list (unquote (+ 1 2)) 4))
; =  (list 3 4)
; '(quasiquote (list (unquote (+ 1 2)) 4))
; =   (list ,(+ 1 2) 4)
; i.e., (quasiquote (list (unquote (+ 1 2)) 4))
; 
; Unpredictable behavior can result if any of the symbols
; quasiquote, unquote, or unquote-splicing appear in po-
; sitions within a  qq template  otherwise than as described
; above.
; 
; 4.3. Macros
; 
; Scheme programs can define and use new derived expres-
; sion types, called macros. Program-defined expression
; types have the syntax
; ( keyword   datum  ...)
; where  keyword  is an identifier that uniquely determines
; the expression type. This identifier is called the syntactic
; keyword, or simply keyword, of the macro. The number of
; the  datum s, and their syntax, depends on the expression
; type.
; Each instance of a macro is called a use of the macro. The
; set of rules that specifies how a use of a macro is transcribed
; into a more primitive expression is called the transformer
; of the macro.
; The macro definition facility consists of two parts:
; 
; * A set of expressions used to establish that certain iden-
; tifiers are macro keywords, associate them with macro
; transformers, and control the scope within which a
; macro is defined, and
; 
; * a pattern language for specifying macro transformers.
; 
; The syntactic keyword of a macro may shadow variable
; bindings, and local variable bindings may shadow keyword
; bindings. All macros defined using the pattern language
; are "hygienic" and "referentially transparent" and thus
; preserve Scheme's lexical scoping [14, 15, 2, 7, 9]:
; 
; 
; 
; 14 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; * If a macro transformer inserts a binding for an identi-
; fier (variable or keyword), the identifier will in effect be
; renamed throughout its scope to avoid conflicts with
; other identifiers. Note that a define at top level may
; or may not introduce a binding; see section 5.2.
; 
; * If a macro transformer inserts a free reference to an
; identifier, the reference refers to the binding that was
; visible where the transformer was specified, regardless
; of any local bindings that may surround the use of the
; macro.
; 
; 
; 4.3.1. Binding constructs for syntactic keywords
; 
; Let-syntax and letrec-syntax are analogous to let and
; letrec, but they bind syntactic keywords to macro trans-
; formers instead of binding variables to locations that con-
; tain values. Syntactic keywords may also be bound at top
; level; see section 5.3.
; 
; (let-syntax  bindings   body )                          syntax
; Syntax:  Bindings  should have the form
; (( keyword   transformer spec ) . . . )
; Each  keyword  is an identifier, each  transformer spec 
; is an instance of syntax-rules, and  body  should be a
; sequence of one or more expressions. It is an error for a
;  keyword  to appear more than once in the list of keywords
; being bound.
; Semantics: The  body  is expanded in the syntactic envi-
; ronment obtained by extending the syntactic environment
; of the let-syntax expression with macros whose keywords
; are the  keyword s, bound to the specified transformers.
; Each binding of a  keyword  has  body  as its region.
; 
; (let-syntax ((when (syntax-rules ()

; (letrec-syntax  bindings   body )                       syntax
; Syntax: Same as for let-syntax.
; Semantics: The  body  is expanded in the syntactic envi-
; ronment obtained by extending the syntactic environment
; of the letrec-syntax expression with macros whose key-
; words are the  keyword s, bound to the specified trans-
; formers. Each binding of a  keyword  has the  bindings 
; as well as the  body  within its region, so the transformers
; can transcribe expressions into uses of the macros intro-
; duced by the letrec-syntax expression.

; 
; 
; 4.3.2. Pattern language
; 
; A  transformer spec  has the following form:
; 
; (syntax-rules  literals   syntax rule  . . . )
; Syntax:       Literals  is a list of identifiers and each
;  syntax rule  should be of the form
; ( pattern   template )
; The  pattern  in a  syntax rule  is a list  pattern  that
; begins with the keyword for the macro.
; A  pattern  is either an identifier, a constant, or one of the
; following
; ( pattern  ...)
; ( pattern   pattern  ... .  pattern )
; ( pattern  ...  pattern   ellipsis )
; #( pattern  ...)
; #( pattern  ...  pattern   ellipsis )
; and a template is either an identifier, a constant, or one of
; the following
; ( element  ...)
; ( element   element  ... .  template )
; #( element  ...)
; where an  element  is a  template  optionally followed by
; an  ellipsis  and an  ellipsis  is the identifier "..." (which
; cannot be used as an identifier in either a template or a
; pattern).
; Semantics: An instance of syntax-rules produces a new
; macro transformer by specifying a sequence of hygienic
; 
; 
; 
; 4. Expressions 15
; 
; rewrite rules. A use of a macro whose keyword is associated
; with a transformer specified by syntax-rules is matched
; against the patterns contained in the  syntax rule s, be-
; ginning with the leftmost  syntax rule . When a match is
; found, the macro use is transcribed hygienically according
; to the template.
; An identifier that appears in the pattern of a  syntax rule 
; is a pattern variable, unless it is the keyword that begins
; the pattern, is listed in  literals , or is the identifier "...".
; Pattern variables match arbitrary input elements and are
; used to refer to elements of the input in the template. It
; is an error for the same pattern variable to appear more
; than once in a  pattern .
; The keyword at the beginning of the pattern in a
;  syntax rule  is not involved in the matching and is not
; considered a pattern variable or literal identifier.
; Rationale:    The scope of the keyword is determined by the
; expression or syntax definition that binds it to the associated
; macro transformer. If the keyword were a pattern variable or
; literal identifier, then the template that follows the pattern
; would be within its scope regardless of whether the keyword
; were bound by let-syntax or by letrec-syntax.
; Identifiers that appear in  literals  are interpreted as literal
; identifiers to be matched against corresponding subforms
; of the input. A subform in the input matches a literal
; identifier if and only if it is an identifier and either both its
; occurrence in the macro expression and its occurrence in
; the macro definition have the same lexical binding, or the
; two identifiers are equal and both have no lexical binding.
; A subpattern followed by ... can match zero or more el-
; ements of the input. It is an error for ... to appear in
;  literals . Within a pattern the identifier ... must follow
; the last element of a nonempty sequence of subpatterns.
; More formally, an input form F matches a pattern P if and
; only if:
; 
; * P is a non-literal identifier; or
; 
; * P is a literal identifier and F is an identifier with the
; same binding; or
; 
; * P is a list (P1 . . . Pn) and F is a list of n forms that
; match P1 through Pn, respectively; or
; * P is an improper list (P1 P2 . . . Pn . Pn+1) and
; F is a list or improper list of n or more forms that
; match P1 through Pn, respectively, and whose nth
; "cdr" matches Pn+1; or
; * P is of the form (P1 . . . Pn Pn+1  ellipsis ) where
;  ellipsis  is the identifier ... and F is a proper list
; of at least n forms, the first n of which match P1
; through Pn, respectively, and each remaining element
; of F matches Pn+1; or
; * P is a vector of the form #(P1 . . . Pn) and F is a
; vector of n forms that match P1 through Pn; or
; * P is of the form #(P1 . . . Pn Pn+1  ellipsis ) where
;  ellipsis  is the identifier ... and F is a vector of n or
; more forms the first n of which match P1 through Pn,
; respectively, and each remaining element of F matches
; Pn+1; or
; * P is a datum and F is equal to P in the sense of the
; equal? procedure.
; 
; It is an error to use a macro keyword, within the scope of
; its binding, in an expression that does not match any of
; the patterns.
; When a macro use is transcribed according to the template
; of the matching  syntax rule , pattern variables that occur
; in the template are replaced by the subforms they match
; in the input. Pattern variables that occur in subpatterns
; followed by one or more instances of the identifier ... are
; allowed only in subtemplates that are followed by as many
; instances of .... They are replaced in the output by all
; of the subforms they match in the input, distributed as
; indicated. It is an error if the output cannot be built up
; as specified.
; Identifiers that appear in the template but are not pattern
; variables or the identifier ... are inserted into the output
; as literal identifiers. If a literal identifier is inserted as a
; free identifier then it refers to the binding of that identifier
; within whose scope the instance of syntax-rules appears.
; If a literal identifier is inserted as a bound identifier then
; it is in effect renamed to prevent inadvertent captures of
; free identifiers.
; As an example, if let and cond are defined as in section 7.3
; then they are hygienic (as required) and the following is not
; an error.
; (let ((=> #f))
; (cond (#t => 'ok)))            =  ok
; 
; The macro transformer for cond recognizes => as a local
; variable, and hence an expression, and not as the top-level
; identifier =>, which the macro transformer treats as a syn-
; tactic keyword. Thus the example expands into
; (let ((=> #f))
; (if #t (begin => 'ok)))
; 
; instead of
; (let ((=> #f))
; (let ((temp #t))
; (if temp ('ok temp))))
; 
; which would result in an invalid procedure call.

; 16 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; 5.      Program structure
; 5.1. Programs
; 
; A Scheme program consists of a sequence of expressions,
; definitions, and syntax definitions. Expressions are de-
; scribed in chapter 4; definitions and syntax definitions are
; the subject of the rest of the present chapter.
; Programs are typically stored in files or entered inter-
; actively to a running Scheme system, although other
; paradigms are possible; questions of user interface lie out-
; side the scope of this report. (Indeed, Scheme would still be
; useful as a notation for expressing computational methods
; even in the absence of a mechanical implementation.)
; Definitions and syntax definitions occurring at the top level
; of a program can be interpreted declaratively. They cause
; bindings to be created in the top level environment or mod-
; ify the value of existing top-level bindings. Expressions
; occurring at the top level of a program are interpreted im-
; peratively; they are executed in order when the program
; is invoked or loaded, and typically perform some kind of
; initialization.
; At the top level of a program (begin  form1  . . . ) is
; equivalent to the sequence of expressions, definitions, and
; syntax definitions that form the body of the begin.
; 
; 
; 5.2. Definitions
; 
; Definitions are valid in some, but not all, contexts where
; expressions are allowed. They are valid only at the top
; level of a  program  and at the beginning of a  body .
; A definition should have one of the following forms:
; 
; * (define  variable   expression )
; 
; * (define ( variable   formals )  body )
;  Formals  should be either a sequence of zero or more
; variables, or a sequence of one or more variables fol-
; lowed by a space-delimited period and another vari-
; able (as in a lambda expression). This form is equiv-
; alent to
; 
; (define  variable 
; (lambda ( formals )  body )).
; 
; * (define ( variable  .  formal )  body )
;  Formal  should be a single variable. This form is
; equivalent to
; 
; (define  variable 
; (lambda  formal   body )).
; 5.2.1. Top level definitions
; 
; At the top level of a program, a definition
; (define  variable   expression )
; has essentially the same effect as the assignment expres-
; sion
; (set!  variable   expression )
; if  variable  is bound. If  variable  is not bound, however,
; then the definition will bind  variable  to a new location
; before performing the assignment, whereas it would be an
; error to perform a set! on an unbound variable.
; (define add3
; (lambda (x) (+ x 3)))
; (add3 3)                          =  6
; (define first car)
; (first '(1 2))                    =  1
; Some implementations of Scheme use an initial environ-
; ment in which all possible variables are bound to locations,
; most of which contain undefined values. Top level defini-
; tions in such an implementation are truly equivalent to
; assignments.
; 
; 5.2.2. Internal definitions
; 
; Definitions may occur at the beginning of a  body  (that
; is, the body of a lambda, let, let*, letrec, let-syntax,
; or letrec-syntax expression or that of a definition of an
; appropriate form). Such definitions are known as internal
; definitions as opposed to the top level definitions described
; above. The variable defined by an internal definition is
; local to the  body . That is,  variable  is bound rather
; than assigned, and the region of the binding is the entire
;  body . For example,
; (let ((x 5))
; (define foo (lambda (y) (bar x y)))
; (define bar (lambda (a b) (+ (* a b) a)))
; (foo (+ x 3)))                  =  45
; A  body  containing internal definitions can always be con-
; verted into a completely equivalent letrec expression. For
; example, the let expression in the above example is equiv-
; alent to
; (let ((x 5))
; (letrec ((foo (lambda (y) (bar x y)))
; (bar (lambda (a b) (+ (* a b) a))))
; (foo (+ x 3))))
; Just as for the equivalent letrec expression, it must be
; possible to evaluate each  expression  of every internal def-
; inition in a  body  without assigning or referring to the

; Wherever an internal definition may occur (begin

; tions that form the body of the begin.

; 5.3. Syntax definitions
; 
; Syntax definitions are valid only at the top level of a
;  program . They have the following form:
; (define-syntax  keyword   transformer spec )
;  Keyword  is an identifier, and the  transformer spec 
; should be an instance of syntax-rules. The top-level syn-
; tactic environment is extended by binding the  keyword 
; to the specified transformer.
; There is no define-syntax analogue of internal defini-
; tions.
; Although macros may expand into definitions and syntax
; definitions in any context that permits them, it is an error
; for a definition or syntax definition to shadow a syntactic
; keyword whose meaning is needed to determine whether
; some form in the group of forms that contains the shad-
; owing definition is in fact a definition, or, for internal def-
; initions, is needed to determine the boundary between the
; group and the expressions that follow the group. For ex-
; ample, the following are errors:
; 
; (define define 3)
; 
; (begin (define begin list))
; 
; (let-syntax
; ((foo (syntax-rules ()
; ((foo (proc args ...) body ...)
; (define proc
; (lambda (args ...)
; body ...))))))
; (let ((x 3))
; (foo (plus x y) (+ x y))
; (define foo x)
; (plus foo x)))

; 6.        Standard procedures
; This chapter describes Scheme's built-in procedures. The
; initial (or "top level") Scheme environment starts out with
; a number of variables bound to locations containing useful
; values, most of which are primitive procedures that ma-
; nipulate data. For example, the variable abs is bound to
; (a location initially containing) a procedure of one argu-
; ment that computes the absolute value of a number, and
; the variable + is bound to a procedure that computes sums.
; Built-in procedures that can easily be written in terms of
; other built-in procedures are identified as "library proce-
; dures".
; A program may use a top-level definition to bind any vari-
; able. It may subsequently alter any such binding by an
; assignment (see 4.1.6). These operations do not modify
; the behavior of Scheme's built-in procedures. Altering any
; top-level binding that has not been introduced by a defini-
; tion has an unspecified effect on the behavior of the built-in
; procedures.
; 
; 6.1. Equivalence predicates
; 
; A predicate is a procedure that always returns a boolean
; value (#t or #f). An equivalence predicate is the compu-
; tational analogue of a mathematical equivalence relation
; (it is symmetric, reflexive, and transitive). Of the equiva-
; lence predicates described in this section, eq? is the finest
; or most discriminating, and equal? is the coarsest. Eqv?
; is slightly less discriminating than eq?.
; 
; (eqv? obj1 obj2)                                      procedure
; The eqv? procedure defines a useful equivalence relation
; on objects. Briefly, it returns #t if obj1 and obj2 should
; normally be regarded as the same object. This relation is
; left slightly open to interpretation, but the following par-
; tial specification of eqv? holds for all implementations of
; Scheme.
; The eqv? procedure returns #t if:
; 
; * obj1 and obj2 are both #t or both #f.
; * obj1 and obj2 are both symbols and
; 
; (string=? (symbol->string obj1)
; (symbol->string obj2))
; =  #t
; 
; Note: This assumes that neither obj1 nor obj2 is an "un-
; interned symbol" as alluded to in section 6.3.3. This re-
; port does not presume to specify the behavior of eqv? on
; implementation-dependent extensions.
; 
; * obj1 and obj2 are both numbers, are numerically equal
; (see =, section 6.2), and are either both exact or both
; inexact.
; 
; * obj1 and obj2 are both characters and are the same
; character according to the char=? procedure (sec-
; tion 6.3.4).
; 
; * both obj1 and obj2 are the empty list.
; * obj1 and obj2 are pairs, vectors, or strings that denote
; the same locations in the store (section 3.4).
; 
; * obj1 and obj2 are procedures whose location tags are
; equal (section 4.1.4).
; 
; The eqv? procedure returns #f if:
; 
; * obj1 and obj2 are of different types (section 3.2).
; 
; 
; 
; 18 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; * one of obj1 and obj2 is #t but the other is #f.
; 
; * obj1 and obj2 are symbols but
; 
; (string=? (symbol->string obj1)
; (symbol->string obj2))
; =  #f
; 
; * one of obj1 and obj2 is an exact number but the other
; is an inexact number.
; 
; * obj1 and obj2 are numbers for which the = procedure
; returns #f.
; 
; * obj1 and obj2 are characters for which the char=? pro-
; cedure returns #f.
; 
; * one of obj1 and obj2 is the empty list but the other is
; not.
; 
; * obj1 and obj2 are pairs, vectors, or strings that denote
; distinct locations.
; 
; * obj1 and obj2 are procedures that would behave differ-
; ently (return different value(s) or have different side
; effects) for some arguments.
;

; The following examples illustrate cases in which the above
; rules do not fully specify the behavior of eqv?. All that
; can be said about such cases is that the value returned by
; eqv? must be a boolean.

; (lambda (x) x))         =  unspecified
; (eqv? (lambda (x) x)
; (lambda (y) y))         =  unspecified
; 
; The next set of examples shows the use of eqv? with pro-
; cedures that have local state. Gen-counter must return a
; distinct procedure every time, since each procedure has its
; own internal counter. Gen-loser, however, returns equiv-
; alent procedures each time, since the local state does not
; affect the value or side effects of the procedures.
; (define gen-counter
; (lambda ()
; (let ((n 0))
; (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) n))))
; (let ((g (gen-counter)))
; (eqv? g g))                  =  #t
; (eqv? (gen-counter) (gen-counter))
; =  #f
; (define gen-loser
; (lambda ()
; (let ((n 0))
; (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) 27))))
; (let ((g (gen-loser)))
; (eqv? g g))                  =  #t
; (eqv? (gen-loser) (gen-loser))

; (letrec ((f (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'f 'both)))
; (g (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'g 'both))))
; (eqv? f g))
; =  #f
; 
; Since it is an error to modify constant objects (those re-
; turned by literal expressions), implementations are per-
; mitted, though not required, to share structure between
; constants where appropriate. Thus the value of eqv? on
; constants is sometimes implementation-dependent.
; (eqv? '(a) '(a))                  =  unspecified
; (eqv? "a" "a")                    =  unspecified

; (let ((x '(a)))
; (eqv? x x))                  =  #t
; 
; Rationale: The above definition of eqv? allows implementa-
; tions latitude in their treatment of procedures and literals: im-
; plementations are free either to detect or to fail to detect that
; two procedures or two literals are equivalent to each other, and
; can decide whether or not to merge representations of equivalent
; objects by using the same pointer or bit pattern to represent
; both.
; 
; (eq? obj1 obj2)                                      procedure
; Eq? is similar to eqv? except that in some cases it is capable
; of discerning distinctions finer than those detectable by
; eqv?.
; Eq? and eqv? are guaranteed to have the same behavior on
; symbols, booleans, the empty list, pairs, procedures, and
; non-empty strings and vectors. Eq?'s behavior on numbers
; and characters is implementation-dependent, but it will al-
; ways return either true or false, and will return true only
; when eqv? would also return true. Eq? may also behave
; differently from eqv? on empty vectors and empty strings.

; Rationale: It will usually be possible to implement eq? much
; more efficiently than eqv?, for example, as a simple pointer com-
; parison instead of as some more complicated operation. One
; reason is that it may not be possible to compute eqv? of two
; numbers in constant time, whereas eq? implemented as pointer
; comparison will always finish in constant time. Eq? may be used
; like eqv? in applications using procedures to implement objects
; with state since it obeys the same constraints as eqv?.

; 6.2. Numbers
; 
; Numerical computation has traditionally been neglected
; by the Lisp community. Until Common Lisp there was
; no carefully thought out strategy for organizing numerical
; computation, and with the exception of the MacLisp sys-
; tem [20] little effort was made to execute numerical code
; efficiently. This report recognizes the excellent work of the
; Common Lisp committee and accepts many of their rec-
; ommendations. In some ways this report simplifies and
; generalizes their proposals in a manner consistent with the
; purposes of Scheme.
; It is important to distinguish between the mathemati-
; cal numbers, the Scheme numbers that attempt to model
; them, the machine representations used to implement the
; Scheme numbers, and notations used to write numbers.
; This report uses the types number, complex, real, rational,
; and integer to refer to both mathematical numbers and
; Scheme numbers. Machine representations such as fixed
; point and floating point are referred to by names such as
; fixnum and flonum.
; 
; 6.2.1. Numerical types
; 
; Mathematically, numbers may be arranged into a tower of
; subtypes in which each level is a subset of the level above
; it:
; number
; complex
; real
; rational
; integer
; For example, 3 is an integer. Therefore 3 is also a rational,
; a real, and a complex. The same is true of the Scheme
; numbers that model 3. For Scheme numbers, these types
; are defined by the predicates number?, complex?, real?,
; rational?, and integer?.
; There is no simple relationship between a number's type
; and its representation inside a computer. Although most
; implementations of Scheme will offer at least two different
; representations of 3, these different representations denote
; the same integer.
; Scheme's numerical operations treat numbers as abstract
; data, as independent of their representation as possible.
; Although an implementation of Scheme may use fixnum,
; flonum, and perhaps other representations for numbers,
; this should not be apparent to a casual programmer writing
; simple programs.
; It is necessary, however, to distinguish between numbers
; that are represented exactly and those that may not be.
; For example, indexes into data structures must be known
; exactly, as must some polynomial coefficients in a symbolic
; algebra system. On the other hand, the results of measure-
; ments are inherently inexact, and irrational numbers may
; be approximated by rational and therefore inexact approx-
; imations. In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where
; exact numbers are required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes
; exact from inexact numbers. This distinction is orthogonal
; to the dimension of type.
; 
; 6.2.2. Exactness
; 
; Scheme numbers are either exact or inexact. A number is
; exact if it was written as an exact constant or was derived
; from exact numbers using only exact operations. A number
; 
; 
; 
; 20 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; is inexact if it was written as an inexact constant, if it
; was derived using inexact ingredients, or if it was derived
; using inexact operations. Thus inexactness is a contagious
; property of a number.
; If two implementations produce exact results for a com-
; putation that did not involve inexact intermediate results,
; the two ultimate results will be mathematically equivalent.
; This is generally not true of computations involving inex-
; act numbers since approximate methods such as floating
; point arithmetic may be used, but it is the duty of each
; implementation to make the result as close as practical to
; the mathematically ideal result.
; Rational operations such as + should always produce ex-
; act results when given exact arguments. If the operation
; is unable to produce an exact result, then it may either
; report the violation of an implementation restriction or it
; may silently coerce its result to an inexact value. See sec-
; tion 6.2.3.
; With the exception of inexact->exact, the operations de-
; scribed in this section must generally return inexact results
; when given any inexact arguments. An operation may,
; however, return an exact result if it can prove that the
; value of the result is unaffected by the inexactness of its
; arguments. For example, multiplication of any number by
; an exact zero may produce an exact zero result, even if the
; other argument is inexact.
; 
; 6.2.3. Implementation restrictions
; 
; Implementations of Scheme are not required to implement
; the whole tower of subtypes given in section 6.2.1, but
; they must implement a coherent subset consistent with
; both the purposes of the implementation and the spirit
; of the Scheme language. For example, an implementation
; in which all numbers are real may still be quite useful.
; Implementations may also support only a limited range of
; numbers of any type, subject to the requirements of this
; section. The supported range for exact numbers of any
; type may be different from the supported range for inex-
; act numbers of that type. For example, an implementation
; that uses flonums to represent all its inexact real numbers
; may support a practically unbounded range of exact inte-
; gers and rationals while limiting the range of inexact reals
; (and therefore the range of inexact integers and rationals)
; to the dynamic range of the flonum format. Furthermore
; the gaps between the representable inexact integers and ra-
; tionals are likely to be very large in such an implementation
; as the limits of this range are approached.
; An implementation of Scheme must support exact integers
; throughout the range of numbers that may be used for
; indexes of lists, vectors, and strings or that may result
; from computing the length of a list, vector, or string. The
; length, vector-length, and string-length procedures
; must return an exact integer, and it is an error to use
; anything but an exact integer as an index. Furthermore
; any integer constant within the index range, if expressed
; by an exact integer syntax, will indeed be read as an exact
; integer, regardless of any implementation restrictions that
; may apply outside this range. Finally, the procedures listed
; below will always return an exact integer result provided all
; their arguments are exact integers and the mathematically
; expected result is representable as an exact integer within
; the implementation:
; 
; +              -               *
; quotient       remainder       modulo
; max            min             abs
; numerator      denominator     gcd
; lcm            floor           ceiling
; truncate       round           rationalize
; expt
; 
; Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to sup-
; port exact integers and exact rationals of practically unlim-
; ited size and precision, and to implement the above proce-
; dures and the / procedure in such a way that they always
; return exact results when given exact arguments. If one of
; these procedures is unable to deliver an exact result when
; given exact arguments, then it may either report a vio-
; lation of an implementation restriction or it may silently
; coerce its result to an inexact number. Such a coercion
; may cause an error later.
; An implementation may use floating point and other ap-
; proximate representation strategies for inexact numbers.
; This report recommends, but does not require, that the
; IEEE 32-bit and 64-bit floating point standards be followed
; by implementations that use flonum representations, and
; that implementations using other representations should
; match or exceed the precision achievable using these float-
; ing point standards [12].
; In particular, implementations that use flonum represen-
; tations must follow these rules: A flonum result must be
; represented with at least as much precision as is used to
; express any of the inexact arguments to that operation. It
; is desirable (but not required) for potentially inexact oper-
; ations such as sqrt, when applied to exact arguments, to
; produce exact answers whenever possible (for example the
; square root of an exact 4 ought to be an exact 2). If, how-
; ever, an exact number is operated upon so as to produce an
; inexact result (as by sqrt), and if the result is represented
; as a flonum, then the most precise flonum format available
; must be used; but if the result is represented in some other
; way then the representation must have at least as much
; precision as the most precise flonum format available.
; Although Scheme allows a variety of written notations for
; numbers, any particular implementation may support only
; some of them. For example, an implementation in which
; all numbers are real need not support the rectangular and
; 
; 
; 
; 6. Standard procedures 21
; 
; polar notations for complex numbers. If an implementa-
; tion encounters an exact numerical constant that it cannot
; represent as an exact number, then it may either report a
; violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently
; represent the constant by an inexact number.
; 
; 6.2.4. Syntax of numerical constants
; 
; The syntax of the written representations for numbers is
; described formally in section 7.1.1. Note that case is not
; significant in numerical constants.
; A number may be written in binary, octal, decimal, or hex-
; adecimal by the use of a radix prefix. The radix prefixes
; are #b (binary), #o (octal), #d (decimal), and #x (hexadec-
; imal). With no radix prefix, a number is assumed to be
; expressed in decimal.
; A numerical constant may be specified to be either exact or
; inexact by a prefix. The prefixes are #e for exact, and #i
; for inexact. An exactness prefix may appear before or after
; any radix prefix that is used. If the written representation
; of a number has no exactness prefix, the constant may be
; either inexact or exact. It is inexact if it contains a decimal
; point, an exponent, or a "#" character in the place of a
; digit, otherwise it is exact.
; In systems with inexact numbers of varying precisions it
; may be useful to specify the precision of a constant. For
; this purpose, numerical constants may be written with an
; exponent marker that indicates the desired precision of the
; inexact representation. The letters s, f, d, and l specify
; the use of short, single, double, and long precision, respec-
; tively. (When fewer than four internal inexact represen-
; tations exist, the four size specifications are mapped onto
; those available. For example, an implementation with two
; internal representations may map short and single together
; and long and double together.) In addition, the exponent
; marker e specifies the default precision for the implemen-
; tation. The default precision has at least as much precision
; as double, but implementations may wish to allow this de-
; fault to be set by the user.

; 
; The reader is referred to section 1.3.3 for a summary of
; the naming conventions used to specify restrictions on the
; types of arguments to numerical routines. The examples
; used in this section assume that any numerical constant
; written using an exact notation is indeed represented as
; an exact number. Some examples also assume that certain
; numerical constants written using an inexact notation can
; be represented without loss of accuracy; the inexact con-
; stants were chosen so that this is likely to be true in imple-
; mentations that use flonums to represent inexact numbers.

; Note: The behavior of these type predicates on inexact num-
; bers is unreliable, since any inaccuracy may affect the result.
; Note: In many implementations the rational? procedure will
; be the same as real?, and the complex? procedure will be the

; to represent some irrational numbers exactly or may extend the
; number system to support some kind of non-complex numbers.

; ponent marker or explicit exactness prefix is used, or if a #
; appears in place of a digit. If all inexact numbers are integers,
; then string->number may return #f whenever a decimal point
; is used.
; 
; 
; 6.3. Other data types
; 
; This section describes operations on some of Scheme's non-
; numeric data types: booleans, pairs, lists, symbols, char-
; acters, strings and vectors.
; 
; 
; 6.3.1. Booleans
; 
; The standard boolean objects for true and false are written
; as #t and #f. What really matters, though, are the objects
; that the Scheme conditional expressions (if, cond, and,
; or, do) treat as true or false. The phrase "a true value"
; (or sometimes just "true") means any object treated as
; true by the conditional expressions, and the phrase "a false
; value" (or "false") means any object treated as false by the
; conditional expressions.
; Of all the standard Scheme values, only #f counts as false
; in conditional expressions. Except for #f, all standard
; Scheme values, including #t, pairs, the empty list, sym-
; bols, numbers, strings, vectors, and procedures, count as
; true.
; Note:       Programmers accustomed to other dialects of Lisp
; should be aware that Scheme distinguishes both #f and the
; empty list from the symbol nil.
; Boolean constants evaluate to themselves, so they do not
; need to be quoted in programs.
; 
; #t                               =  #t
; #f                               =  #f
; '#f                              =  #f
; 
; 
; (not obj )                                   library procedure
; Not returns #t if obj is false, and returns #f otherwise.
;

; (boolean? 0)                   =  #f
; (boolean? '())                 =  #f
; 
; 
; 6.3.2. Pairs and lists
; 
; A pair (sometimes called a dotted pair) is a record structure
; with two fields called the car and cdr fields (for historical
; reasons). Pairs are created by the procedure cons. The
; car and cdr fields are accessed by the procedures car and
; cdr. The car and cdr fields are assigned by the procedures
; set-car! and set-cdr!.
; Pairs are used primarily to represent lists. A list can be
; defined recursively as either the empty list or a pair whose
; cdr is a list. More precisely, the set of lists is defined as
; the smallest set X such that
; 
; * The empty list is in X .
; 
; * If list is in X , then any pair whose cdr field contains
; list is also in X .
; 
; The objects in the car fields of successive pairs of a list are
; the elements of the list. For example, a two-element list
; is a pair whose car is the first element and whose cdr is a
; pair whose car is the second element and whose cdr is the
; empty list. The length of a list is the number of elements,
; which is the same as the number of pairs.
; The empty list is a special object of its own type (it is not
; a pair); it has no elements and its length is zero.
; Note:     The above definitions imply that all lists have finite
; length and are terminated by the empty list.
; The most general notation (external representation) for
; Scheme pairs is the "dotted" notation (c1 . c2) where c1
; is the value of the car field and c2 is the value of the cdr
; field. For example (4 . 5) is a pair whose car is 4 and
; whose cdr is 5. Note that (4 . 5) is the external repre-
; sentation of a pair, not an expression that evaluates to a
; pair.
; A more streamlined notation can be used for lists: the
; elements of the list are simply enclosed in parentheses and
; separated by spaces. The empty list is written () . For
; example,
; 
; (a b c d e)
; 
; and
; 
; (a . (b . (c . (d . (e . ())))))
; 
; 
; 
; 26 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; are equivalent notations for a list of symbols.
; A chain of pairs not ending in the empty list is called an
; improper list. Note that an improper list is not a list.
; The list and dotted notations can be combined to represent
; improper lists:
; (a b c . d)
; is equivalent to
; (a . (b . (c . d)))
; Whether a given pair is a list depends upon what is stored
; in the cdr field. When the set-cdr! procedure is used, an
; object can be a list one moment and not the next:
; (define x (list 'a 'b 'c))
; (define y x)
; y                              =  (a b c)
; (list? y)                      =  #t
; (set-cdr! x 4)                 =  unspecified
; x                              =  (a . 4)
; (eqv? x y)                     =  #t
; y                              =  (a . 4)
; (list? y)                      =  #f
; (set-cdr! x x)                 =  unspecified
; (list? x)                      =  #f
; Within literal expressions and representations of ob-
; jects read by the read procedure, the forms ' datum ,
;   datum , , datum , and ,@ datum  denote two-ele-
; ment lists whose first elements are the symbols quote,
; quasiquote, unquote, and unquote-splicing, respec-
; tively. The second element in each case is  datum . This
; convention is supported so that arbitrary Scheme pro-
; grams may be represented as lists.      That is, according
; to Scheme's grammar, every  expression  is also a  datum 
; (see section 7.1.2). Among other things, this permits the
; use of the read procedure to parse Scheme programs. See
; section 3.3.

; 6.3.3. Symbols
; 
; Symbols are objects whose usefulness rests on the fact that
; two symbols are identical (in the sense of eqv?) if and only
; if their names are spelled the same way. This is exactly the
; property needed to represent identifiers in programs, and
; so most implementations of Scheme use them internally for
; that purpose. Symbols are useful for many other applica-
; tions; for instance, they may be used the way enumerated
; values are used in Pascal.
; The rules for writing a symbol are exactly the same as the
; rules for writing an identifier; see sections 2.1 and 7.1.1.
; It is guaranteed that any symbol that has been returned as
; part of a literal expression, or read using the read proce-
; dure, and subsequently written out using the write proce-
; dure, will read back in as the identical symbol (in the sense
; of eqv?). The string->symbol procedure, however, can
; create symbols for which this write/read invariance may
; not hold because their names contain special characters or
; letters in the non-standard case.
; Note: Some implementations of Scheme have a feature known
; as "slashification" in order to guarantee write/read invariance
; for all symbols, but historically the most important use of this
; feature has been to compensate for the lack of a string data
; type.
; Some implementations also have "uninterned symbols", which
; defeat write/read invariance even in implementations with
; slashification, and also generate exceptions to the rule that two
; symbols are the same if and only if their names are spelled the
; same.

; (symbol->string symbol)                              procedure
; Returns the name of symbol as a string. If the symbol
; was part of an object returned as the value of a literal
; expression (section 4.1.2) or by a call to the read proce-
; dure, and its name contains alphabetic characters, then the
; string returned will contain characters in the implementa-
; tion's preferred standard case-some implementations will
; prefer upper case, others lower case. If the symbol was re-
; turned by string->symbol, the case of characters in the
; string returned will be the same as the case in the string
; that was passed to string->symbol. It is an error to apply
; mutation procedures like string-set! to strings returned
; by this procedure.
; The following examples assume that the implementation's
; standard case is lower case:
; 
; (symbol->string 'flying-fish)=  "flying-fish"
; (symbol->string 'Martin)             =  "martin"

; can create symbols with names containing special charac-
; ters or letters in the non-standard case, but it is usually
; a bad idea to create such symbols because in some imple-
; mentations of Scheme they cannot be read as themselves.
; See symbol->string.

; 6.3.4. Characters
; 
; Characters are objects that represent printed characters
; such as letters and digits. Characters are written using the
; notation #\ character  or #\ character name . For exam-
; ple:
; 
; 
; #\a            ; lower case letter
; #\A            ; upper case letter
; #\(            ; left parenthesis
; #\             ; the space character
; #\space        ; the preferred way to write a space
; #\newline ; the newline character
; 
; Case is significant in #\ character , but not in #\ character
; name . If  character  in #\ character  is alphabetic, then
; the character following  character  must be a delimiter
; character such as a space or parenthesis. This rule resolves
; the ambiguous case where, for example, the sequence of
; 
; 
; 
; 6. Standard procedures 29
; 
; characters "#\space" could be taken to be either a repre-
; sentation of the space character or a representation of the
; character "#\s" followed by a representation of the symbol
; "pace."
; Characters written in the #\ notation are self-evaluating.
; That is, they do not have to be quoted in programs.
; Some of the procedures that operate on characters ignore
; the difference between upper case and lower case. The pro-
; cedures that ignore case have "-ci" (for "case insensitive")
; embedded in their names.
; 
; (char? obj )                                      procedure
; Returns #t if obj is a character, otherwise returns #f.
; 
; (char=? char1 char2)                              procedure
; (char<? char1 char2)                              procedure
; (char>? char1 char2)                              procedure
; (char<=? char1 char2)                             procedure
; (char>=? char1 char2)                             procedure
; These procedures impose a total ordering on the set of
; characters. It is guaranteed that under this ordering:
; 
; * The upper case characters are in order. For example,
; (char<? #\A #\B) returns #t.
; 
; * The lower case characters are in order. For example,
; (char<? #\a #\b) returns #t.
; 
; * The digits are in order. For example, (char<? #\0
; #\9) returns #t.
; 
; * Either all the digits precede all the upper case letters,
; or vice versa.
; 
; * Either all the digits precede all the lower case letters,
; or vice versa.
; 
; Some implementations may generalize these procedures to
; take more than two arguments, as with the corresponding
; numerical predicates.
; 
; (char-ci=? char1 char2)                   library procedure
; (char-ci<? char1 char2)                   library procedure
; (char-ci>? char1 char2)                   library procedure
; (char-ci<=? char1 char2)                  library procedure
; (char-ci>=? char1 char2)                  library procedure
; These procedures are similar to char=? et cetera, but they
; treat upper case and lower case letters as the same. For
; example, (char-ci=? #\A #\a) returns #t. Some imple-
; mentations may generalize these procedures to take more
; than two arguments, as with the corresponding numerical
; predicates.
; (char-alphabetic? char)                    library procedure
; (char-numeric? char)                       library procedure
; (char-whitespace? char)                    library procedure
; (char-upper-case? letter)                  library procedure
; (char-lower-case? letter)                  library procedure
; These procedures return #t if their arguments are alpha-
; betic, numeric, whitespace, upper case, or lower case char-
; acters, respectively, otherwise they return #f. The follow-
; ing remarks, which are specific to the ASCII character set,
; are intended only as a guide: The alphabetic characters are
; the 52 upper and lower case letters. The numeric charac-
; ters are the ten decimal digits. The whitespace characters
; are space, tab, line feed, form feed, and carriage return.
; 
; (char->integer char)                              procedure
; (integer->char n)                                 procedure
; Given a character, char->integer returns an exact inte-
; ger representation of the character. Given an exact inte-
; ger that is the image of a character under char->integer,
; integer->char returns that character. These procedures
; implement order-preserving isomorphisms between the set
; of characters under the char<=? ordering and some subset
; of the integers under the <= ordering. That is, if
; 
; (char<=? a b) =  #t and (<= x y) =  #t
; 
; and x and y are in the domain of integer->char, then
; 
; (<= (char->integer a)
; (char->integer b))         =  #t
; 
; (char<=? (integer->char x)
; (integer->char y)) =  #t
; 
; 
; (char-upcase char)                         library procedure
; (char-downcase char)                       library procedure
; These procedures return a character char2 such that
; (char-ci=? char char2). In addition, if char is alpha-
; betic, then the result of char-upcase is upper case and
; the result of char-downcase is lower case.
; 
; 
; 6.3.5. Strings
; 
; Strings are sequences of characters. Strings are written
; as sequences of characters enclosed within doublequotes
; ("). A doublequote can be written inside a string only by
; escaping it with a backslash (\), as in
; 
; "The word \"recursion\" has many meanings."
; 
; A backslash can be written inside a string only by escaping
; it with another backslash. Scheme does not specify the
; effect of a backslash within a string that is not followed by
; a doublequote or backslash.
; 
; 
; 
; 30 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; A string constant may continue from one line to the next,
; but the exact contents of such a string are unspecified.
; The length of a string is the number of characters that it
; contains. This number is an exact, non-negative integer
; that is fixed when the string is created. The valid indexes
; of a string are the exact non-negative integers less than
; the length of the string. The first character of a string has
; index 0, the second has index 1, and so on.
; In phrases such as "the characters of string beginning with
; index start and ending with index end," it is understood
; that the index start is inclusive and the index end is ex-
; clusive. Thus if start and end are the same index, a null
; substring is referred to, and if start is zero and end is the
; length of string, then the entire string is referred to.
; Some of the procedures that operate on strings ignore the
; difference between upper and lower case. The versions that
; ignore case have "-ci" (for "case insensitive") embedded
; in their names.

; 
; 6.3.6. Vectors
; 
; Vectors are heterogenous structures whose elements are in-
; dexed by integers. A vector typically occupies less space
; than a list of the same length, and the average time re-
; quired to access a randomly chosen element is typically
; less for the vector than for the list.
; The length of a vector is the number of elements that it
; contains. This number is a non-negative integer that is
; fixed when the vector is created. The valid indexes of a
; vector are the exact non-negative integers less than the
; length of the vector. The first element in a vector is indexed
; by zero, and the last element is indexed by one less than
; the length of the vector.
; Vectors are written using the notation #(obj . . . ). For
; example, a vector of length 3 containing the number zero
; in element 0, the list (2 2 2 2) in element 1, and the
; string "Anna" in element 2 can be written as following:
; #(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")
; Note that this is the external representation of a vector, not
; an expression evaluating to a vector. Like list constants,
; vector constants must be quoted:
; '#(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")
; =  #(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")

; 
; Here is a possible implementation of delay and force.
; Promises are implemented here as procedures of no argu-
; ments, and force simply calls its argument:
; (define force
; (lambda (object)
; (object)))
; 
; We define the expression
; (delay  expression )
; 
; to have the same meaning as the procedure call
; (make-promise (lambda ()  expression ))
; 
; as follows
; (define-syntax delay
; (syntax-rules ()
; ((delay expression)
; (make-promise (lambda () expression))))),
; 
; 
; 
; 6. Standard procedures 33
; 
; where make-promise is defined as follows:
; (define make-promise
; (lambda (proc)
; (let ((result-ready? #f)
; (result #f))
; (lambda ()
; (if result-ready?
; result
; (let ((x (proc)))
; (if result-ready?
; result
; (begin (set! result-ready? #t)
; (set! result x)
; result))))))))
; 
; Rationale:     A promise may refer to its own value, as in the
; last example above. Forcing such a promise may cause the
; promise to be forced a second time before the value of the first
; force has been computed. This complicates the definition of
; make-promise.
; Various extensions to this semantics of delay and force
; are supported in some implementations:
; 
; * Calling force on an object that is not a promise may
; simply return the object.
; 
; * It may be the case that there is no means by which
; a promise can be operationally distinguished from its
; forced value. That is, expressions like the following
; may evaluate to either #t or to #f, depending on the
; implementation:
; 
; (eqv? (delay 1) 1)                  =  unspecified
; (pair? (delay (cons 1 2))) =  unspecified
; 
; * Some implementations may implement "implicit forc-
; ing," where the value of a promise is forced by primi-
; tive procedures like cdr and +:
; 
; (+ (delay (* 3 7)) 13)              =  34

; (call-with-current-continuation proc)                    procedure
; Proc must be a procedure of one argument. The procedure
; call-with-current-continuation packages up the cur-
; rent continuation (see the rationale below) as an "escape
; procedure" and passes it as an argument to proc. The es-
; cape procedure is a Scheme procedure that, if it is later
; called, will abandon whatever continuation is in effect at
; that later time and will instead use the continuation that
; was in effect when the escape procedure was created. Call-
; ing the escape procedure may cause the invocation of before
; and after thunks installed using dynamic-wind.
; The escape procedure accepts the same number of ar-
; guments as the continuation to the original call to
; call-with-current-continuation. Except for continua-
; tions created by the call-with-values procedure, all con-
; tinuations take exactly one value. The effect of passing no
; value or more than one value to continuations that were
; not created by call-with-values is unspecified.
; The escape procedure that is passed to proc has unlimited
; extent just like any other procedure in Scheme. It may be
; stored in variables or data structures and may be called as
; many times as desired.
; The following examples show only the most common ways
; in which call-with-current-continuation is used. If
; all real uses were as simple as these examples, there
; would be no need for a procedure with the power of
; call-with-current-continuation.
; (call-with-current-continuation

; (for-each (lambda (x)
; (if (negative? x)
; (exit x)))

; (lambda (obj)
; (call-with-current-continuation
; (lambda (return)
; (letrec ((r(lambda (obj)
; (cond ((null? obj) 0)
; ((pair? obj)
; (+ (r (cdr obj)) 1))
; (else (return #f))))))
; (r obj))))))
; 
; (list-length '(1 2 3 4))           =  4
; 
; (list-length '(a b . c))           =  #f
; 
; Rationale:
; A common use of call-with-current-continuation is for
; structured, non-local exits from loops or procedure bodies, but
; in fact call-with-current-continuation is extremely useful
; for implementing a wide variety of advanced control structures.
; Whenever a Scheme expression is evaluated there is a contin-
; uation wanting the result of the expression. The continuation
; represents an entire (default) future for the computation. If the
; expression is evaluated at top level, for example, then the con-
; tinuation might take the result, print it on the screen, prompt
; for the next input, evaluate it, and so on forever. Most of the
; time the continuation includes actions specified by user code,
; as in a continuation that will take the result, multiply it by the
; value stored in a local variable, add seven, and give the answer
; to the top level continuation to be printed. Normally these
; ubiquitous continuations are hidden behind the scenes and pro-
; grammers do not think much about them. On rare occasions,
; however, a programmer may need to deal with continuations ex-
; plicitly. Call-with-current-continuation allows Scheme pro-
; 
; 
; 
; 34 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; grammers to do that by creating a procedure that acts just like
; the current continuation.
; Most programming languages incorporate one or more special-
; purpose escape constructs with names like exit, return, or
; even goto. In 1965, however, Peter Landin [16] invented a
; general purpose escape operator called the J-operator. John
; Reynolds [24] described a simpler but equally powerful con-
; struct in 1972. The catch special form described by Sussman
; and Steele in the 1975 report on Scheme is exactly the same as
; Reynolds's construct, though its name came from a less general
; construct in MacLisp. Several Scheme implementors noticed
; that the full power of the catch construct could be provided by
; a procedure instead of by a special syntactic construct, and the
; name call-with-current-continuation was coined in 1982.
; This name is descriptive, but opinions differ on the merits of
; such a long name, and some people use the name call/cc in-
; stead.
; 
; 
; (values obj . . .)                                   procedure
;
; Delivers all of its arguments to its continuation. Except
; for continuations created by the call-with-values pro-
; cedure, all continuations take exactly one value. Values
; might be defined as follows:
;
; (define (values . things)
;  (call-with-current-continuation
;   (lambda (cont) (apply cont things))))
; 
; 
; (call-with-values producer consumer)                 procedure
;
; Calls its producer argument with no values and a contin-
; uation that, when passed some values, calls the consumer
; procedure with those values as arguments. The continua-
; tion for the call to consumer is the continuation of the call
; to call-with-values.
;
; (call-with-values (lambda () (values 4 5))
;                   (lambda (a b) b))

;

; 
; 
; (dynamic-wind before thunk after)                    procedure
;
; Calls thunk without arguments, returning the result(s) of
; this call. Before and after are called, also without ar-
; guments, as required by the following rules (note that
; in the absence of calls to continuations captured using
; call-with-current-continuation the three arguments
; are called once each, in order). Before is called whenever
; execution enters the dynamic extent of the call to thunk
; and after is called whenever it exits that dynamic extent.
; The dynamic extent of a procedure call is the period be-
; tween when the call is initiated and when it returns. In
; Scheme, because of call-with-current-continuation,
; the dynamic extent of a call may not be a single, connected
; time period. It is defined as follows:
; 
; * The dynamic extent is entered when execution of the
; body of the called procedure begins.
; 
; * The dynamic extent is also entered when exe-
; cution is not within the dynamic extent and a
; continuation is invoked that was captured (using
; call-with-current-continuation) during the dy-
; namic extent.
; 
; * It is exited when the called procedure returns.
; 
; * It is also exited when execution is within the dynamic
; extent and a continuation is invoked that was captured
; while not within the dynamic extent.
; 
; If a second call to dynamic-wind occurs within the dynamic
; extent of the call to thunk and then a continuation is in-
; voked in such a way that the afters from these two invoca-
; tions of dynamic-wind are both to be called, then the after
; associated with the second (inner) call to dynamic-wind is
; called first.
; If a second call to dynamic-wind occurs within the dy-
; namic extent of the call to thunk and then a continua-
; tion is invoked in such a way that the befores from these
; two invocations of dynamic-wind are both to be called,
; then the before associated with the first (outer) call to
; dynamic-wind is called first.
; If invoking a continuation requires calling the before from
; one call to dynamic-wind and the after from another, then
; the after is called first.
; The effect of using a captured continuation to enter or exit
; the dynamic extent of a call to before or after is undefined.

; 6. Standard procedures 35
; 
; 6.5. Eval
; 
; 
; (eval expression environment-specifier)            procedure
; Evaluates expression in the specified environment and re-
; turns its value. Expression must be a valid Scheme expres-
; sion represented as data, and environment-specifier must
; be a value returned by one of the three procedures de-
; scribed below. Implementations may extend eval to allow
; non-expression programs (definitions) as the first argument
; and to allow other values as environments, with the re-
; striction that eval is not allowed to create new bindings
; in the environments associated with null-environment or
; scheme-report-environment.
; (eval '(* 7 3) (scheme-report-environment 5))
; =  21
; 
; (let ((f (eval '(lambda (f x) (f x x))
; (null-environment 5))))
; (f + 10))
; =  20
; 
; 
; (scheme-report-environment version)                procedure
; (null-environment version)                         procedure
; Version must be the exact integer 5, corresponding to this
; revision of the Scheme report (the Revised5 Report on
; Scheme). Scheme-report-environment returns a specifier
; for an environment that is empty except for all bindings de-
; fined in this report that are either required or both optional
; and supported by the implementation. Null-environment
; returns a specifier for an environment that is empty except
; for the (syntactic) bindings for all syntactic keywords de-
; fined in this report that are either required or both optional
; and supported by the implementation.
; Other values of version can be used to specify environments
; matching past revisions of this report, but their support is
; not required. An implementation will signal an error if
; version is neither 5 nor another value supported by the
; implementation.
; The effect of assigning (through the use of eval) a vari-
; able bound in a scheme-report-environment (for exam-
; ple car) is unspecified. Thus the environments specified
; by scheme-report-environment may be immutable.
; 
; (interaction-environment)                optional procedure
; This procedure returns a specifier for the environment that
; contains implementation-defined bindings, typically a su-
; perset of those listed in the report. The intent is that this
; procedure will return the environment in which the imple-
; mentation would evaluate expressions dynamically typed
; by the user.
; 6.6. Input and output
; 
; 6.6.1. Ports
; 
; Ports represent input and output devices. To Scheme, an
; input port is a Scheme object that can deliver characters
; upon command, while an output port is a Scheme object
; that can accept characters.
; 
; (call-with-input-file string proc) library procedure
; (call-with-output-file string proc) library procedure
; String should be a string naming a file, and proc
; should be a procedure that accepts one argument. For
; call-with-input-file, the file should already exist; for
; call-with-output-file, the effect is unspecified if the
; file already exists. These procedures call proc with one ar-
; gument: the port obtained by opening the named file for
; input or output. If the file cannot be opened, an error is
; signalled. If proc returns, then the port is closed automati-
; cally and the value(s) yielded by the proc is(are) returned.
; If proc does not return, then the port will not be closed
; automatically unless it is possible to prove that the port
; will never again be used for a read or write operation.
; Rationale:    Because Scheme's escape procedures have un-
; limited extent, it is possible to escape from the current con-
; tinuation but later to escape back in. If implementations
; were permitted to close the port on any escape from the
; current continuation, then it would be impossible to write
; portable code using both call-with-current-continuation
; and call-with-input-file or call-with-output-file.
; 
; 
; (input-port? obj )                                 procedure
; (output-port? obj )                                procedure
; Returns #t if obj is an input port or output port respec-
; tively, otherwise returns #f.
; 
; (current-input-port)                               procedure
; (current-output-port)                              procedure
; Returns the current default input or output port.
; 
; (with-input-from-file string thunk)optional procedure
; (with-output-to-file string thunk)optional procedure
; String should be a string naming a file, and proc should be
; a procedure of no arguments. For with-input-from-file,
; the file should already exist; for with-output-to-file,
; the effect is unspecified if the file already exists. The
; file is opened for input or output, an input or output
; port connected to it is made the default value returned
; by current-input-port or current-output-port (and is
; 
; 
; 
; 36 Revised5 Scheme
; 
; used by (read), (write obj ), and so forth), and the thunk
; is called with no arguments. When the thunk returns,
; the port is closed and the previous default is restored.
; With-input-from-file and with-output-to-file re-
; turn(s) the value(s) yielded by thunk. If an escape pro-
; cedure is used to escape from the continuation of these
; procedures, their behavior is implementation dependent.
; 
; 
; (open-input-file filename)                         procedure
; Takes a string naming an existing file and returns an input
; port capable of delivering characters from the file. If the
; file cannot be opened, an error is signalled.
; 
; 
; (open-output-file filename)                        procedure
; Takes a string naming an output file to be created and
; returns an output port capable of writing characters to a
; new file by that name. If the file cannot be opened, an
; error is signalled. If a file with the given name already
; exists, the effect is unspecified.
; 
; 
; (close-input-port port)                            procedure
; (close-output-port port)                           procedure
; Closes the file associated with port, rendering the port in-
; capable of delivering or accepting characters. These rou-
; tines have no effect if the file has already been closed. The
; value returned is unspecified.
; 
; 
; 6.6.2. Input
; 
; 
; (read)                                     library procedure
; (read port)                                library procedure
; Read converts external representations of Scheme objects
; into the objects themselves. That is, it is a parser for the
; nonterminal  datum  (see sections 7.1.2 and 6.3.2). Read
; returns the next object parsable from the given input port,
; updating port to point to the first character past the end
; of the external representation of the object.
; If an end of file is encountered in the input before any char-
; acters are found that can begin an object, then an end of
; file object is returned. The port remains open, and fur-
; ther attempts to read will also return an end of file object.
; If an end of file is encountered after the beginning of an
; object's external representation, but the external represen-
; tation is incomplete and therefore not parsable, an error is
; signalled.
; The port argument may be omitted, in which case it de-
; faults to the value returned by current-input-port. It is
; an error to read from a closed port.
; (read-char)                                           procedure
; (read-char port)                                      procedure
; Returns the next character available from the input port,
; updating the port to point to the following character. If
; no more characters are available, an end of file object is
; returned. Port may be omitted, in which case it defaults
; to the value returned by current-input-port.
; 
; 
; (peek-char)                                           procedure
; (peek-char port)                                      procedure
; Returns the next character available from the input port,
; without updating the port to point to the following char-
; acter. If no more characters are available, an end of file
; object is returned. Port may be omitted, in which case it
; defaults to the value returned by current-input-port.
; Note: The value returned by a call to peek-char is the same as
; the value that would have been returned by a call to read-char
; with the same port. The only difference is that the very next call
; to read-char or peek-char on that port will return the value
; returned by the preceding call to peek-char. In particular, a
; call to peek-char on an interactive port will hang waiting for
; input whenever a call to read-char would have hung.
; 
; 
; (eof-object? obj )                                    procedure
; Returns #t if obj is an end of file object, otherwise returns
; #f. The precise set of end of file objects will vary among
; implementations, but in any case no end of file object will
; ever be an object that can be read in using read.
; 
; 
; (char-ready?)                                         procedure
; (char-ready? port)                                    procedure
; Returns #t if a character is ready on the input port and
; returns #f otherwise. If char-ready returns #t then the
; next read-char operation on the given port is guaranteed
; not to hang. If the port is at end of file then char-ready?
; returns #t. Port may be omitted, in which case it defaults
; to the value returned by current-input-port.
; Rationale: Char-ready? exists to make it possible for a pro-
; gram to accept characters from interactive ports without getting
; stuck waiting for input. Any input editors associated with such
; ports must ensure that characters whose existence has been as-
; serted by char-ready? cannot be rubbed out. If char-ready?
; were to return #f at end of file, a port at end of file would
; be indistinguishable from an interactive port that has no ready
; characters.

; 
; 
; 6. Standard procedures 37
; 
; (write obj )                                library procedure
; (write obj port)                            library procedure
; Writes a written representation of obj to the given port.
; Strings that appear in the written representation are en-
; closed in doublequotes, and within those strings backslash
; and doublequote characters are escaped by backslashes.
; Character objects are written using the #\ notation. Write
; returns an unspecified value. The port argument may be
; omitted, in which case it defaults to the value returned by
; current-output-port.
; 
; (display obj )                              library procedure
; (display obj port)                          library procedure
; Writes a representation of obj to the given port. Strings
; that appear in the written representation are not enclosed
; in doublequotes, and no characters are escaped within
; those strings. Character objects appear in the represen-
; tation as if written by write-char instead of by write.
; Display returns an unspecified value. The port argument
; may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the value re-
; turned by current-output-port.
; Rationale: Write is intended for producing machine-readable
; output and display is for producing human-readable output.
; Implementations that allow "slashification" within symbols will
; probably want write but not display to slashify funny charac-
; ters in symbols.
; 
; (newline)                                   library procedure
; (newline port)                              library procedure
; Writes an end of line to port. Exactly how this is done
; differs from one operating system to another. Returns
; an unspecified value. The port argument may be omit-
; ted, in which case it defaults to the value returned by
; current-output-port.
; 
; (write-char char)                                   procedure
; (write-char char port)                              procedure
; Writes the character char (not an external representa-
; tion of the character) to the given port and returns an
; unspecified value.     The port argument may be omit-
; ted, in which case it defaults to the value returned by
; current-output-port.
; 
; 6.6.4. System interface
; 
; Questions of system interface generally fall outside of the
; domain of this report. However, the following operations
; are important enough to deserve description here.
; 
; (load filename)                           optional procedure
; Filename should be a string naming an existing file con-
; taining Scheme source code. The load procedure reads ex-
; pressions and definitions from the file and evaluates them
; sequentially. It is unspecified whether the results of the
; expressions are printed. The load procedure does not
; affect the values returned by current-input-port and
; current-output-port. Load returns an unspecified value.
; Rationale: For portability, load must operate on source files.
; Its operation on other kinds of files necessarily varies among
; implementations.
; 
; 
; (transcript-on filename)                 optional procedure
; (transcript-off)                         optional procedure
; Filename must be a string naming an output file to be cre-
; ated. The effect of transcript-on is to open the named
; file for output, and to cause a transcript of subsequent
; interaction between the user and the Scheme system to
; be written to the file. The transcript is ended by a call
; to transcript-off, which closes the transcript file. Only
; one transcript may be in progress at any time, though some
; implementations may relax this restriction. The values re-
; turned by these procedures are unspecified.

; This chapter provides formal descriptions of what has al-
; ready been described informally in previous chapters of this
; report.
; 
; 
; 7.1. Formal syntax
; 
; This section provides a formal syntax for Scheme written
; in an extended BNF.
; All spaces in the grammar are for legibility. Case is insignif-
; icant; for example, #x1A and #X1a are equivalent.  empty 
; stands for the empty string.
; The following extensions to BNF are used to make the de-
; scription more concise:  thing * means zero or more occur-
; rences of  thing ; and  thing + means at least one  thing .
; 
; 7.1.1. Lexical structure
; 
; This section describes how individual tokens (identifiers,
; numbers, etc.) are formed from sequences of characters.
; The following sections describe how expressions and pro-
; grams are formed from sequences of tokens.
;  Intertoken space  may occur on either side of any token,
; but not within a token.
; Tokens which require implicit termination (identifiers,
; numbers, characters, and dot) may be terminated by any
;  delimiter , but not necessarily by anything else.

; nesting depth.

; In  quasiquotation s, a  list qq template D  can some-

;  unquotation  or  splicing unquotation D  takes prece-
; dence.

; 7.2. Formal semantics
; 
; This section provides a formal denotational semantics for
; the primitive expressions of Scheme and selected built-in
; procedures. The concepts and notation used here are de-
; scribed in [29]; the notation is summarized below:
;   . . .         sequence formation
; s   k           kth member of the sequence s (1-based)
; #s              length of sequence s
; s § t           concatenation of sequences s and t
; s   k           drop the first k members of sequence s
; t   a, b McCarthy conditional "if t then a else b"
;  [x/i]          substitution "  with x for i"
; x in D          injection of x into domain D
; x | D           projection of x to domain D
; The reason that expression continuations take sequences
; of values instead of single values is to simplify the formal
; treatment of procedure calls and multiple return values.
; The boolean flag associated with pairs, vectors, and strings
; will be true for mutable objects and false for immutable
; objects.
; The order of evaluation within a call is unspecified. We
; mimic that here by applying arbitrary permutations per-
; mute and unpermute, which must be inverses, to the argu-
; ments in a call before and after they are evaluated. This is
; not quite right since it suggests, incorrectly, that the order
; of evaluation is constant throughout a program (for any
; given number of arguments), but it is a closer approxima-
; tion to the intended semantics than a left-to-right evalua-
; tion would be.
; The storage allocator new is implementation-dependent,
; but it must obey the following axiom: if new     L, then
;   (new   | L)   2 = false.
; The definition of K is omitted because an accurate defini-
; tion of K would complicate the semantics without being
; very interesting.
; If P is a program in which all variables are defined before
; being referenced or assigned, then the meaning of P is
; E[[((lambda (I*) P')  undefined  . . . )]]
; 
; 
; 
; 7. Formal syntax and semantics 41
; 
; where I* is the sequence of variables defined in P, P  is the
; sequence of expressions obtained by replacing every defini-
; tion in P by an assignment,  undefined  is an expression
; that evaluates to undefined, and E is the semantic function
; that assigns meaning to expressions.

; The following letrec macro uses the symbol <undefined>
; in place of an expression which returns something that
; when stored in a location makes it an error to try to ob-
; tain the value stored in the location (no such expression is
; defined in Scheme). A trick is used to generate the tempo-
; rary names needed to avoid specifying the order in which
; the values are evaluated. This could also be accomplished
; by using an auxiliary macro.

; NOTES
; 
; Language changes
; 
; This section enumerates the changes that have been made
; to Scheme since the "Revised4 report" [6] was published.
; 
; * The report is now a superset of the IEEE standard
; for Scheme [13]: implementations that conform to the
; report will also conform to the standard. This required
; the following changes:
; 
; ­ The empty list is now required to count as true.
; ­ The classification of features as essential or
; inessential has been removed. There are now
; three classes of built-in procedures: primitive, li-
; brary, and optional. The optional procedures are
; load, with-input-from-file, with-output-
; to-file, transcript-on, transcript-off, and
; interaction-environment, and - and / with
; more than two arguments. None of these are in
; the IEEE standard.
; ­ Programs are allowed to redefine built-in proce-
; dures. Doing so will not change the behavior of
; other built-in procedures.
; 
; * Port has been added to the list of disjoint types.
; 
; * The macro appendix has been removed. High-level
; macros are now part of the main body of the report.
; The rewrite rules for derived expressions have been
; replaced with macro definitions. There are no reserved
; identifiers.
; 
; * Syntax-rules now allows vector patterns.
; 
; * Multiple-value returns, eval, and dynamic-wind have
; been added.
; 
; * The calls that are required to be implemented in a
; properly tail-recursive fashion are defined explicitly.
; 
; * `@' can be used within identifiers. `|' is reserved for
; possible future extensions.
; 
; 
; ADDITIONAL MATERIAL
; The Internet Scheme Repository at
; http://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/
; contains an extensive Scheme bibliography, as well as pa-
; pers, programs, implementations, and other material re-
; lated to Scheme.

; Integrate-system integrates the system
; 
; y k = fk(y1, y2, . . . , yn), k = 1, . . . , n
; of differential equations with the method of Runge-Kutta.
; The parameter system-derivative is a function that
; takes a system state (a vector of values for the state vari-
; ables y1, . . . , yn) and produces a system derivative (the val-
; ues y 1, . . . , y n). The parameter initial-state provides
; an initial system state, and h is an initial guess for the
; length of the integration step.
; The value returned by integrate-system is an infinite
; stream of system states.

; derivative from a system state. Runge-Kutta-4 produces
