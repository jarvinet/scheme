<h2>Portable syntax-case</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb">R. Kent Dybvig</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~owaddell">Oscar Waddell</a>
</p>

<p>
The syntax-case macro system implements the restricted high-level
<code>syntax-rules</code> macros of the Revised<sup>5</sup> Report
as well as the equally high-level but general-purpose
<code>syntax-case</code> macros.
It also supports a compatible module system that allows import and
export of macro bindings as well as bindings for variables and
modules.
</p>

<p>
The system is documented in Chapters 3 and 8 of
<a href="http://www.scheme.com/tspl2d/"><i>The Scheme Programming
Language, second edition</i></a> and in Chapter 9 of the
<a href="http://www.scheme.com/csug/"><i>Chez Scheme User's
Guide</i></a>.
The former has more introductory material and examples, while the
latter documents some
aspects of the system not covered by the former.
</p>

</p>
Aspects of the system and its implementation are described in
<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/papers/syntactic-abstract.html">Syntactic
abstraction in Scheme</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/papers/popl99-abstract.html">Extending
the Scope of Syntactic Abstraction</a>.
</p>

<p>
The portable system is designed to be adaptable with minimal effort to
any Revised<sup>5</sup> Report implementation of Scheme, with the
provision of a small set of implementation-dependent hooks to install
the expander.
Included with the portable expander are definitions of each of the
syntactic forms supported by the Revised<sup>5</sup> Report.
Along with a reader, the system forms a complete front-end for Scheme.
If the reader and evaluator support source annotations (e.g., file
and line number information), these are handled as well to provide
source-object correlation.
</p>

<p>
The portable syntax-case implementation consists of one file,
<a href="psyntax.ss">psyntax.ss</a>.
The file <a href="psyntax.pp">psyntax.pp</a> is
an expanded version of the file that may be used for bootstrapping
the system.  See the porting notes in psyntax.ss
</p>

<p>
Please let us know if you successfully port this code to a new Scheme
implementation, and also please allow us to include the hooks you
develop in doing the port in this directory for use by others.
</p>

<p>
Please also contact us if you have difficulty porting to a new Scheme
implementation or if you discover that the implementation depends on
nonportable features of Chez Scheme in some undocumented way.

<h3>Release notes</h3>

<p>
<b>Version 6.9</b>
(<a href="6.9/psyntax.ss">psyntax.ss</a>,
 <a href="6.9/psyntax.pp">psyntax.pp</a>)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(07/12/02)
Changed <code>chi-top-module</code> so that definitions and initialization
forms in compiled files are not evaluated (by default) at visit time.
</p>

<p>
(06/04/02)
Recoded <code>generate-id</code> so that generated symbols have a
standard print representation and to avoid ASCII dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Extended the syntax of <code>syntax-case</code> patterns to allow a
fixed number of items after an ellipsis.
Ellipses are therefore no longer constrained to appear only at the end
of a list- or vector-structured form, but only one ellipsis can appear
at a given level of a list- or vector-structured form.
For example, <code>(a ... b)</code> matches a list of one or more
elements, with <code>b</code> bound to the last element and
<code>a ...</code> to all but the last element.
</p>

<p>
(05/31/02)
Added a local definition for a one-clause version of <code>let-values</code> 
and recoded uses of <code>call-with-values</code> using
<code>let-values</code>.
</p>

<p>
Fixed two bugs in the portable expander.
One resulted in an error in <code>vector-ref</code> when redefining
a variable at top level that was previously imported from a module.
The other caused the wrong identifier to be exported in certain
circumstances, perhaps resulting in an inappropriate identifier out of
context error.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Version 6.8</b>
(<a href="6.8/psyntax.ss">psyntax.ss</a>,
 <a href="6.8/psyntax.pp">psyntax.pp</a>)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(02/06/02)
Added support for <code>visit</code> and <code>revisit</code> procedures,
which are relevant for systems that support <code>compile-file</code>:
<code>visit</code> is like <code>load</code> but loads only compile-time
information, and <code>revisit</code> is like <code>load</code> but loads
only run-time information.
</p>

<p>
Cleaned up and extended <code>eval-when</code> to handle new situations
<code>visit</code> and <code>revisit</code>.
A translation table that clearly shows what happens with nested
<code>eval-when</code> forms is given in the source.
</p>

<p>
Added <code>literal-identifier=?</code>.
<code>literal-identifier=?</code> is similar to
<code>free-identifier=?</code> except that the former equates
top-level identifiers that come from different modules, even if they
do not necessarily resolve to the same binding.
<code>syntax-rules</code> and <code>syntax-case</code> employ
literal-identifier=? to compare identifiers listed in the literals list
against input identifiers.
<code>literal-identifier=?</code> is intended for the
comparison of auxiliary keywords such as
<code>else</code> in <code>cond</code> and <code>case</code>, where
no actual binding is involved.
</p>

<p>
Fixed a bug in the portable expander that caused an application of
<code>cdr</code> to the empty list in <code>build-sequence</code>
for top-level modules with no exported definitions other than
reexports, e.g.,

<pre>
(module m1 (a) (define a 3))
(module m2 (a) (import m1))
(let () (import m2) a) ;=> 3
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Fixed a bug in the portable expander that prevented use of "hidden"
top-level definitions in the output of a macro, e.g.:

<pre>
(define-syntax counter
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ ref incr e)
     (begin
       (define hidden e)
       (define ref (lambda () hidden))
       (define incr (lambda (n) (set! hidden (+ hidden n))))))))
(counter get bump 17)
(get) ;=> 17
(bump 4)
(get) ;=> 21
hidden ;=> unbound error
</pre>
</p>

<p>
An incompatible change to the expander has been
made to reduce the loss of source information when one macro generates
another macro definition: List and vector structure in the subexpression
of a syntax form is no longer guaranteed to be list and vector structure
in the output form except where pattern variables are contained within
that structure.
For example, <code>#'(a&nbsp;...)</code>, where <code>a</code> is a pattern
variable, is guaranteed to evaluate to a list, but the constant
structure <code>(a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d)</code>, none of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>,
<code>c</code>, and <code>d</code> are pattern variables, may not.
The practical consequence of this change is that constant
structures must be deconstructed using <code>syntax-case</code> or
<code>syntax-rules</code> rather than <code>car</code>, <code>cdr</code>,
and other list-processing operations.
</p>

<a href="../tspl2d/">The Scheme Programming Langauge, Second Edition</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
