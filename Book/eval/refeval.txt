How to pass arguments by reference.

Ordinary Scheme passes arguments by value. In this execrise we will examine
how to pass arguments by reference (as is possible in e.g. Pascal).

In Scheme, the procedure application creates a new environment frame that
contains bindings where each parameter of the applied procedure is bound to
the correspongind argument in the application. Thus if the procedure changes
the value of any of its parameters, it changes its local copy of it.
